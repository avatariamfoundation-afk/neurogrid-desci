# PUBLIC_RESEARCH_DASHBOARD_SPEC.md

## 1. PURPOSE
This specification defines the requirements for the Public Research Dashboard used to communicate DeSci-governed research activity, status, and high-level outcomes to external stakeholders in a transparent, accurate, and non-misleading manner.

The dashboard is an accountability interface, not a promotional surface.

## 2. SCOPE
This specification applies to all public-facing dashboard components that display:
- Research projects and status
- Aggregate research metrics
- Governance-approved disclosures
- Methodological summaries
- Oversight-relevant indicators

The dashboard must not expose protected, sensitive, or regulated content.

## 3. DESIGN PRINCIPLES
The dashboard must adhere to:
- Accuracy over completeness
- Contextual clarity
- Non-clinical representation
- Governance-controlled disclosure
- Auditability and traceability

Public visibility does not imply unrestricted access.

## 4. PERMITTED CONTENT CATEGORIES
The dashboard may display:
- Research project titles and objectives
- High-level methodologies
- Status indicators (planned, active, completed)
- Aggregate performance summaries
- Published outputs and references
- Governance approvals and timestamps

All content must be approved for disclosure.

## 5. PROHIBITED CONTENT
The dashboard must not display:
- Raw or patient-level data
- Identifiable or re-identifiable information
- Model internals or proprietary logic
- Unvalidated results
- Clinical recommendations or claims
- Security-sensitive system details

Violation constitutes a disclosure breach.

## 6. DATA SOURCES AND INTEGRITY
Dashboard content must:
- Be sourced from governed repositories
- Be version-controlled
- Include update timestamps
- Be traceable to approval records

Manual or ad hoc updates are prohibited.

## 7. UPDATE AND PUBLICATION CONTROLS
All dashboard updates require:
- Review and approval by research governance
- Compliance verification
- Logged publication events

Automated updates must enforce the same controls.

## 8. CONTEXTUAL DISCLAIMERS
The dashboard must prominently state:
- Research-only intent
- Non-clinical, non-diagnostic status
- Advisory-only nature of AI research
- Limitations and uncertainty

Absence of disclaimers is non-compliant.

## 9. USER INTERACTION LIMITS
The public dashboard must:
- Be read-only
- Prevent data export beyond approved summaries
- Disable inference-enabling queries

Interactive analytics are restricted unless approved.

## 10. ACCESSIBILITY AND USABILITY
The dashboard must:
- Be accessible across standard platforms
- Use clear, non-technical language where appropriate
- Avoid misinterpretation by non-expert audiences

Clarity is a safety control.

## 11. LOGGING AND AUDITABILITY
All dashboard content changes must be:
- Logged and timestamped
- Attributable to authorized actors
- Retained for audit and oversight review

Unlogged changes are invalid.

## 12. INCIDENT HANDLING
If incorrect or misleading content is identified:
- Immediate correction or removal is required
- Root cause analysis must be performed
- Prior disclosures must be assessed

Public error persistence is a governance breach.

## 13. OVERSIGHT
The dashboard is subject to:
- Periodic oversight review
- Disclosure audits
- Independent verification

Oversight findings may mandate changes.

## 14. REGULATORY ALIGNMENT
This specification aligns with:
- EU AI Act transparency obligations
- Open science governance principles
- GDPR and LGPD public disclosure constraints
- Responsible research communication standards
