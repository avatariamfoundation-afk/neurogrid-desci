# RESEARCH_REPRODUCIBILITY_STANDARD.md

## 1. PURPOSE
This standard defines the mandatory requirements for research reproducibility across all DeSci-governed scientific activities. Its objective is to ensure that research outputs are verifiable, repeatable, auditable, and scientifically defensible across time, teams, and jurisdictions.

Reproducibility is treated as a core integrity control, not an academic preference.

## 2. SCOPE
This standard applies to:
- AI model research and experimentation
- Data-driven clinical studies
- Algorithmic validation studies
- Post-market performance analysis
- External collaborative research conducted under DeSci governance

No research output may be recognized or relied upon without meeting this standard.

## 3. REPRODUCIBILITY PRINCIPLES
All research must adhere to:
- Determinism where feasible
- Transparent methodology
- Traceable inputs and outputs
- Controlled environments
- Explicit documentation of uncertainty

## 4. DATA REPRODUCIBILITY REQUIREMENTS
Research datasets must:
- Be uniquely identified and versioned
- Include complete provenance and lineage records
- Be immutable once used in published results
- Be accessible under governed conditions for verification

Any data preprocessing must be fully documented.
