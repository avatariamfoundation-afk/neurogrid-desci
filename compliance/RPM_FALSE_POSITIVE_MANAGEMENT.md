# RPM_FALSE_POSITIVE_MANAGEMENT.md  
**False Positive Control, Mitigation & Accountability Framework for RPM Systems**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **mandatory framework** for identifying, managing, mitigating, and auditing false positives generated by Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) systems within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

The objective is to:
- Protect patient safety
- Prevent clinician alert fatigue
- Preserve clinical trust in AI-assisted monitoring
- Maintain regulatory compliance
- Prevent normalization of unsafe overrides

False positives are treated as **system performance risks**, not benign errors.

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:
- AI-driven RPM alerts
- Rule-based physiological threshold alerts
- Hybrid AI-clinician systems
- Pre-market testing, clinical deployment, and post-market surveillance

It covers:
- Detection
- Classification
- Response
- Suppression controls
- Continuous improvement

---

## 3. Definition of False Positive

A **false positive** is defined as:

> An RPM alert that meets technical trigger criteria but does **not** correspond to a clinically meaningful or actionable patient condition upon human review.

False positives may arise from:
- Sensor noise or malfunction
- Data latency or corruption
- Inaccurate baseline calibration
- Model drift
- Contextual misinterpretation

---

## 4. Core Principles

All false positive management must adhere to:

- **Patient Safety First**
- **Human Oversight Supremacy**
- **Transparency of Model Limitations**
- **Non-Suppression Without Review**
- **Continuous Performance Accountability**

False positives must never be silently ignored.

---

## 5. False Positive Classification

### Type A – Technical Artifact
- Sensor error
- Transmission fault
- Data corruption

### Type B – Physiological Variability
- Benign patient-specific fluctuations
- Temporary non-pathological changes

### Type C – Model Misinterpretation
- Incorrect pattern recognition
- Insufficient context awareness

### Type D – Threshold Misconfiguration
- Improper clinical parameter ranges
- Poor personalization

Each false positive must be categorized.

---

## 6. Mandatory Review Process

For every suspected false positive:
1. Alert is reviewed by qualified personnel
2. Clinical relevance is assessed
3. Classification is assigned
4. Rationale is documented
5. Outcome is logged

No alert may be dismissed without documentation.

---

## 7. Human Override Controls

- Human overrides are permitted but regulated
- Override requires justification
- Repeated overrides trigger system review
- Overrides are subject to audit

Overrides are **exceptions**, not workflow.

---

## 8. Alert Fatigue Safeguards

To mitigate alert fatigue:
- Tiered alert severity
- Adaptive thresholds with clinician approval
- Scheduled alert load reviews
- Alert density monitoring

Disabling alerts to reduce workload is prohibited.

---

## 9. Suppression Rules

Alert suppression:
- Must be time-bound
- Must be reversible
- Requires authorization
- Must be logged

Permanent suppression requires governance approval.

---

## 10. Model Performance Feedback Loop

False positives feed into:
- Model retraining datasets
- Threshold recalibration
- Feature importance review
- Bias and drift analysis

Performance metrics include:
- False positive rate
- Precision
- Clinician override frequency

---

## 11. Patient Communication

When false positives trigger patient contact:
- Explanation must be clear and non-alarming
- Communication must be documented
- Patient trust must be preserved

Patients must not be burdened by system errors.

---

## 12. Regulatory & Standards Alignment

This framework aligns with:
- FDA SaMD performance monitoring guidance
- EU MDR post-market surveillance
- ANVISA vigilance requirements
- ISO 14971 risk management
- IEC 62304 lifecycle controls
- LGPD / GDPR data governance

---

## 13. Audit & Reporting

False positive handling is subject to:
- Routine internal audits
- External regulatory review
- Post-incident investigation

Metrics are reported at defined governance intervals.

---

## 14. Escalation Triggers

Immediate escalation is required if:
- False positives exceed defined thresholds
- Alert fatigue compromises response time
- Model behavior degrades unexpectedly
- Patient harm risk increases

Escalation supersedes performance optimization.

---

## 15. Ethical Position

> **An ignored alert trains negligence.  
> A managed false positive trains safety.**

---

## 16. Review & Amendment

This document is reviewed:
- Quarterly
- After model updates
- Following critical incidents
- Upon regulatory change

Amendments require:
- Clinical approval
- Compliance sign-off
- Ethics review

---

### Status
**Active – Mandatory Compliance Control**

Applies to all NeuroGrid RPM systems, AI models, clinical staff, and monitoring operations.
