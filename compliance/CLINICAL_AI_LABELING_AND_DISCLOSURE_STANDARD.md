# CLINICAL_AI_LABELING_AND_DISCLOSURE_STANDARD.md
Mandatory Transparency & User Awareness Framework

---

## 1. Purpose

This document establishes the **mandatory labeling and disclosure requirements** for all Clinical AI systems within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its objectives are to:
- Ensure clinicians and users clearly understand AI system roles
- Prevent misinterpretation of AI outputs as clinical judgment
- Meet regulatory transparency obligations
- Protect patient safety and informed decision-making

AI labeling is treated as a **clinical safety and compliance control**, not a documentation formality.

---

## 2. Scope

This standard applies to:
- All Clinical AI and RPM systems
- User interfaces, dashboards, and alerts
- Clinical reports and summaries
- Documentation provided to clinicians, patients, and institutions
- Research and investigational deployments where applicable

It applies across **MedIntel execution**, **DeSci governance**, and **Core audit enforcement** layers.

---

## 3. Labeling Principles

All Clinical AI systems must adhere to the following principles:

1. **Clarity** – AI involvement must be unambiguous  
2. **Non-Deception** – No implication of human judgment  
3. **Contextual Disclosure** – Disclosures must appear at point of use  
4. **Consistency** – Language must be uniform across all surfaces  
5. **Clinical Conservatism** – When uncertain, disclose more, not less  

---

## 4. Mandatory AI Identification

All Clinical AI systems must clearly display:
- That the system uses AI or machine learning
- The system’s role (e.g., monitoring, alerting, decision support)
- That outputs are **advisory only**, unless otherwise approved
- That final clinical decisions rest with qualified clinicians

AI identification must be visible and not buried in secondary documentation.

---

## 5. Intended Use Disclosure

Each system must disclose:
- Approved intended use
- Clinical context limitations
- Target user type (e.g., clinician, researcher)
- Deployment status (clinical, investigational, research-only)

No system may be used outside its disclosed intended use.

---

## 6. Performance & Limitation Disclosure

Mandatory disclosures include:
- Known performance limitations
- Known failure modes
- Data scope limitations
- Population or setting constraints
- Situations where AI outputs may be unreliable

Claims of accuracy must be qualified and evidence-based.

---

## 7. Automation Boundary Disclosure

Users must be informed of:
- Which actions are automated
- Which actions require human confirmation
- What the system **cannot** do
- That autonomous clinical actions are prohibited unless explicitly approved

Any automated component must be clearly labeled.

---

## 8. Model Update & Version Disclosure

Systems must disclose:
- Current model version
- Date of last update
- Whether behavior may change over time
- Whether retraining occurs post-deployment

Significant changes require renewed disclosure acknowledgment.

---

## 9. Patient-Facing Disclosure (Where Applicable)

When AI outputs affect patient-facing workflows:
- AI involvement must be disclosed in plain language
- No technical jargon may obscure meaning
- Consent documentation must reference AI usage

Patients must not be led to believe they are interacting solely with human judgment.

---

## 10. Prohibited Labeling Practices

The following are prohibited:
- Ambiguous or euphemistic AI references
- Human-like naming that implies agency
- Claims of diagnosis or treatment without approval
- Concealing AI involvement
- Selective disclosure based on audience

Violations trigger immediate compliance review.

---

## 11. Audit & Verification

Compliance is enforced through:
- UI and documentation audits
- Labeling consistency checks
- Regulatory review readiness
- Independent oversight review

Non-compliant systems may be suspended.

---

## 12. Regulatory Alignment

This standard aligns with:
- FDA clinical decision support transparency requirements
- EU AI Act user disclosure obligations
- EU MDR labeling standards
- ISO/IEC 62304 documentation principles
- OECD AI transparency guidelines

---

## 13. Ethical Position

> **Users deserve to know when intelligence is artificial.**

Transparency is a prerequisite for trust in clinical systems.

---

## 14. Binding Status

This document is:
- Mandatory across all Clinical AI deployments
- Enforced through governance and compliance mechanisms
- Subject to external and internal audit
- Amendable only via approved governance process
