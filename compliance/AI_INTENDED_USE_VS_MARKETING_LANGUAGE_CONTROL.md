# AI_INTENDED_USE_VS_MARKETING_LANGUAGE_CONTROL
Clinical Integrity & Regulatory Safeguard Framework

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **mandatory controls** governing alignment between **AI intended use** and all **marketing, communications, and public-facing language** within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its objectives are to:
- Prevent overstatement or misrepresentation of AI capabilities
- Ensure regulatory-safe communications
- Protect clinical users and patients from misleading claims
- Maintain legal, ethical, and scientific integrity

Misalignment between intended use and marketing language is treated as a **regulatory and safety violation**, not a branding issue.

---

## 2. Scope

This control applies to:
- All AI and ML models deployed within NeuroGrid
- All RPM and clinical decision-support systems
- Websites, whitepapers, investor decks, and public documentation
- Press releases, social media, and promotional materials
- DAO communications referencing AI capabilities

It spans **DeSci governance**, **MedIntel clinical execution**, and **Core compliance enforcement**.

---

## 3. Definitions

**Intended Use**  
The formally approved description of what an AI system is designed to do, under what conditions, and for which users, as documented in:
- Intended Use Statements
- Regulatory filings
- Model approval records

**Marketing Language**  
Any public or semi-public communication describing AI functionality, performance, benefits, or outcomes.

---

## 4. Core Principles

1. **Intended Use Supremacy** – Intended use documentation overrides all marketing narratives  
2. **No Capability Inflation** – Capabilities must not be implied beyond validation scope  
3. **Clinical Conservatism** – When ambiguous, claims must be minimized  
4. **Evidence-Based Claims** – All statements must be supportable by data  
5. **Regulatory First** – Compliance obligations supersede growth objectives  

---

## 5. Prohibited Marketing Practices

The following are strictly prohibited:
- Claims of diagnosis, treatment, or cure unless explicitly approved
- Implying autonomous clinical decision-making
- Using terms such as “guarantees,” “eliminates risk,” or “always accurate”
- Representing advisory systems as prescriptive
- Comparing performance without validated benchmarks
- Suggesting regulatory approval where none exists

Violations trigger immediate review and corrective action.

---

## 6. Approved Language Categories

Marketing language must be limited to one or more of the following categories:

- **Clinical Decision Support** (non-autonomous, advisory)
- **Risk Stratification Assistance**
- **Monitoring and Alerting Support**
- **Workflow Optimization**
- **Research and Investigational Use** (where applicable)

Each category must map directly to an approved intended use statement.

---

## 7. Mandatory Review & Approval Process

All AI-related communications must undergo:
1. **Intended Use Mapping Review**
2. **Compliance and Regulatory Review**
3. **Clinical Safety Review** (if patient-facing)
4. **Final Approval Logging**

No material may be published without documented approval.

---

## 8. Change Control

If:
- Intended use changes, or
- Model capabilities evolve, or
- New evidence becomes available

Then:
- Marketing language must be reviewed and updated immediately
- Outdated claims must be retracted
- A change log must be maintained

Lag between intended use updates and marketing updates is a compliance failure.

---

## 9. Monitoring & Enforcement

Enforcement mechanisms include:
- Periodic content audits
- Automated keyword and claim scanning
- Whistleblower reporting channels
- Oversight body review authority

Detected violations may result in:
- Content takedown
- DAO sanctions
- Regulatory notification
- Model suspension

---

## 10. Documentation & Auditability

The following must be retained:
- Approved intended use statements
- Marketing content versions
- Review and approval records
- Change logs and corrective actions

All records must be auditable and immutable.

---

## 11. Regulatory Alignment

This control aligns with:
- FDA intended use and labeling requirements
- EU AI Act transparency and claims restrictions
- EU MDR and IVDR marketing controls
- FTC truth-in-advertising standards
- OECD AI governance principles

---

## 12. Ethical Position

> **Trust is lost when systems are sold as more than they are.**

Clinical AI must be described with precision, humility, and evidence.

---

## 13. Binding Status

This document is:
- Mandatory across all NeuroGrid entities
- Enforced through governance and compliance controls
- Subject to independent oversight
- Amendable only via approved DAO governance process
