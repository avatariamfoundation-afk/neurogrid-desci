# RPM_THRESHOLD_PERSONALIZATION_POLICY.md  
**Personalized Threshold Governance for Remote Patient Monitoring**

---

## 1. Purpose

This policy defines how **Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) alert thresholds** may be personalized within the NeuroGrid ecosystem while maintaining clinical safety, regulatory compliance, and ethical integrity.

Personalization is permitted **only when governed, auditable, and clinically justified**.

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:
- All RPM systems using wearable or subcutaneous bio-cybernetic devices
- Post-operative monitoring AI models
- Threshold-based alerting systems
- Clinical decision support interfaces
- Automated and semi-automated monitoring pipelines

---

## 3. Core Principle

> **Personalization enhances care only when bounded by safety.**

Personalized thresholds must never reduce patient safety below approved clinical baselines.

---

## 4. Definition of Threshold Personalization

Threshold personalization refers to the **adjustment of alert trigger values** based on:
- Patient-specific physiology
- Surgical context
- Baseline health status
- Recovery trajectory
- Clinician-approved modifications

Personalization does **not** mean unrestricted AI-driven adjustment.

---

## 5. Eligible Parameters

Threshold personalization may apply to:
- Heart rate variability
- Oxygen saturation
- Temperature
- Blood pressure
- Activity recovery metrics
- Wound healing indicators
- Implant telemetry signals

Each parameter requires explicit approval for personalization.

---

## 6. Personalization Eligibility Criteria

Thresholds may be personalized only if:
- Baseline data is clinically validated
- Patient consent is recorded
- Clinician approval is documented
- Safety bounds remain enforced
- Audit logging is enabled

All five criteria are mandatory.

---

## 7. Safety Boundaries

Personalized thresholds must:
- Remain within clinically approved ranges
- Never suppress critical alerts
- Include absolute hard-stop limits
- Default to conservative values upon uncertainty

Hard safety limits cannot be overridden.

---

## 8. Personalization Methods

Allowed methods include:
- Clinician-configured adjustments
- Protocol-driven recovery phase mapping
- Supervised AI recommendations with human approval

Prohibited methods include:
- Fully autonomous threshold drift
- Unbounded reinforcement learning
- Non-interpretable threshold changes

---

## 9. AI Role and Constraints

AI systems may:
- Recommend threshold adjustments
- Detect recovery patterns
- Flag personalization risks

AI systems may not:
- Auto-apply threshold changes
- Remove safety floors
- Override clinician authority

---

## 10. Governance and Authorization

All personalization actions require:
- Role-based authorization
- Timestamped records
- Justification metadata
- Version control linkage

Governance approval pathways must be predefined.

---

## 11. Monitoring and Review

Personalized thresholds are subject to:
- Continuous performance monitoring
- Alert outcome analysis
- False-positive/false-negative review
- Scheduled reassessment

Thresholds must revert if risk increases.

---

## 12. Reversion Protocols

Immediate reversion is required when:
- Data quality degrades
- Device malfunction occurs
- Model confidence drops
- Adverse events are reported

Reversion defaults to system baseline thresholds.

---

## 13. Patient Transparency

Patients must be informed:
- That thresholds may be personalized
- What parameters are affected
- That safety bounds remain enforced
- How to escalate concerns

Transparency is mandatory.

---

## 14. Audit and Traceability

All personalization actions must be:
- Logged immutably
- Traceable to decision authority
- Reviewable during audits
- Linked to outcome data

Audit failure constitutes policy violation.

---

## 15. Regulatory Alignment

This policy aligns with:
- FDA RPM and CDS guidance
- EU MDR and AI Act safety requirements
- ISO 14971 risk controls
- IEC 62304 lifecycle safety
- LGPD, GDPR, and HIPAA principles

---

## 16. Ethical Position

> **Personalization must never become invisibility.**

Alerts must remain visible, interpretable, and accountable.

---

## 17. Enforcement

Violations may result in:
- Threshold lockout
- Model restriction
- Governance sanctions
- Regulatory reporting

---

## 18. Binding Status

This policy is:
- Mandatory for all RPM systems
- Enforced via governance mechanisms
- Subject to continuous audit
- Modifiable only via approved change control

---
