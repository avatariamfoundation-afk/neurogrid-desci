# AI Override Abuse Prevention Policy

## 1. Purpose
This policy establishes safeguards to prevent misuse, overuse, or manipulation of AI emergency override mechanisms within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

The objective is to ensure that overrides remain a **patient-safety instrument**, not a tool for convenience, performance manipulation, political pressure, or governance abuse.

---

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to:
- All AI emergency override mechanisms
- All NeuroGrid clinical AI systems
- All personnel with override authority
- All governance, compliance, and audit entities

It covers all operational environments, including production, trials, and emergency deployments.

---

## 3. Definition of Override Abuse
Override abuse includes, but is not limited to:

- Triggering overrides without valid safety justification
- Using overrides to suppress unfavorable model outputs
- Repeated overrides without corrective action
- Overrides initiated for reputational, financial, or political reasons
- Overrides used to bypass governance or accountability
- Coordinated override actions to manipulate system behavior

Any override not grounded in patient safety is considered suspect.

---

## 4. Abuse Risk Indicators
The following indicators require investigation:

- High-frequency override activity by a single actor
- Overrides occurring without documented triggers
- Overrides coinciding with governance disputes
- Overrides followed by data deletion or suppression
- Overrides preventing audit visibility
- Overrides disproportionately affecting specific cohorts

Detection of these indicators triggers automatic review.

---

## 5. Preventive Controls
NeuroGrid enforces the following controls:

- Role-based override permissions
- Mandatory justification entry at activation
- Immutable override logs
- Time-bound override expiration
- Multi-role notification requirements
- Independent compliance monitoring

No override mechanism may operate without traceability.

---

## 6. Separation of Authority
To prevent concentration of power:

- Override initiators may not audit their own actions
- Governance bodies cannot retroactively legitimize abuse
- Token holders have no override privileges
- Engineering teams cannot self-authorize overrides

Authority separation is mandatory and enforced.

---

## 7. Monitoring and Detection
Override activity is continuously monitored using:

- Behavioral pattern analysis
- Frequency and duration thresholds
- Cross-role correlation checks
- Automated abuse flagging triggers

Flagged events escalate immediately to compliance review.

---

## 8. Investigation Process
When abuse is suspected:

1. Immediate override suspension (if active)
2. Preservation of all logs and evidence
3. Independent compliance review
4. Role interviews and justification review
5. Risk impact assessment
6. Governance notification

Investigations prioritize system integrity and patient trust.

---

## 9. Consequences of Abuse
Confirmed abuse may result in:

- Permanent loss of override privileges
- Role suspension or removal
- DAO sanctions or expulsion
- Regulatory disclosure
- Legal action where applicable

No immunity exists for override misuse.

---

## 10. Whistleblower Protection
Individuals reporting override abuse are protected from:

- Retaliation
- Role demotion
- Governance pressure
- Token or funding penalties

Anonymous reporting channels must be maintained.

---

## 11. Transparency and Reporting
Override abuse statistics must be:

- Included in public accountability reports
- Reviewed during governance audits
- Available to regulators upon request

Transparency is non-negotiable.

---

## 12. Regulatory Alignment
This policy aligns with:
- EU AI Act misuse prevention mandates
- FDA post-market controls
- ISO AI governance principles
- GDPR and LGPD accountability standards
- Medical ethics non-maleficence requirements

---

## 13. Review Cycle
This policy is reviewed:
- Annually
- After any confirmed abuse incident
- Following regulatory changes
- Upon system architecture updates
