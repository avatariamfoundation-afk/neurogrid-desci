**Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) Framework for NeuroGrid Systems**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) Plan** for NeuroGrid technologies, including:

- Smart contracts
- Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) systems
- AI-assisted clinical decision-support tools
- Decentralized data registries

The PMS framework ensures continuous **safety, performance, compliance, and ethical oversight** after deployment.

---

## 2. Scope

This PMS plan applies to:

- Deployed smart contracts (Core, DeSci Registry, Governance)
- RPM signal processing pipelines
- AI models used for clinical insight generation
- Data ingestion, storage, and access mechanisms
- DAO governance mechanisms impacting clinical or research outcomes

It covers **all post-deployment lifecycle stages**.

---

## 3. Regulatory Alignment

This PMS framework aligns with:

- EU MDR (Articles 83–86)
- FDA Post-Market Surveillance Guidance
- ISO 13485 (Quality Management)
- ISO 14971 (Risk Management)
- IEC 62304 (Medical Software Lifecycle)
- LGPD / GDPR ongoing compliance obligations

---

## 4. PMS Objectives

Primary objectives include:

- Early detection of safety signals
- Monitoring real-world performance
- Identification of adverse events
- Detection of misuse or drift
- Continuous risk-benefit assessment
- Regulatory readiness

---

## 5. Data Sources for Surveillance

PMS data is collected from:

### 5.1 Technical Sources
- Smart contract event logs
- System uptime and error logs
- AI inference confidence metrics
- Sensor reliability indicators

### 5.2 Clinical & Operational Sources
- Clinician feedback
- RPM alert outcomes
- Post-operative monitoring reports
- False positive / false negative analysis

### 5.3 Governance & Community Sources
- DAO proposals
- Contributor disputes
- Ethics committee findings
- External audits

---

## 6. Adverse Event Definition

An **adverse event** is any incident where:

- Patient safety may be compromised
- RPM alerts fail to escalate appropriately
- AI outputs contribute to clinical misunderstanding
- Data misuse or breach occurs
- Governance decisions introduce safety risk

Adverse events may be **clinical, technical, ethical, or governance-related**.

---

## 7. Incident Classification

| Level | Description | Action |
|-----|------------|-------|
| Minor | No patient impact | Logged & reviewed |
| Moderate | Potential risk | Investigation required |
| Serious | Patient harm possible | Immediate escalation |
| Critical | Life-threatening risk | Emergency protocol |

---

## 8. Signal Detection & Trend Analysis

PMS continuously evaluates:

- Alert frequency changes
- Model performance drift
- Data quality degradation
- Repeated governance conflicts
- Unexpected usage patterns

Automated monitoring is paired with **human review**.

---

## 9. Corrective & Preventive Actions (CAPA)

When risks are identified, NeuroGrid may initiate:

- Model retraining or rollback
- Smart contract patching (with audit trail)
- Alert threshold recalibration
- Governance rule amendments
- Temporary feature suspension

All CAPA actions are documented and reviewable.

---

## 10. Roles & Responsibilities

### 10.1 PMS Oversight Body
- Multidisciplinary (technical, clinical, ethics)
- Independent from daily operations
- Authority to halt deployments

### 10.2 DAO Responsibilities
- Approve major corrective actions
- Ensure transparency
- Maintain audit accessibility

### 10.3 Contributors
- Report incidents
- Cooperate with investigations
- Adhere to remediation protocols

---

## 11. Reporting Obligations

Serious incidents must be reported:

- To relevant regulators (where applicable)
- To governance bodies
- To affected stakeholders

Reporting timelines follow jurisdictional requirements.

---

## 12. Documentation & Audit Trail

All PMS activities must maintain:

- Immutable logs
- Time-stamped records
- Clear decision rationales
- Versioned documentation

Records must be retained according to regulatory standards.

---

## 13. Continuous Improvement Loop

PMS findings directly inform:

- Risk management updates
- Ethics framework revisions
- Governance refinements
- Product roadmap decisions

PMS is a **living system**, not a static obligation.

---

## 14. Transparency & Public Accountability

Where appropriate, anonymized PMS summaries may be:

- Published publicly
- Shared with research partners
- Used to inform contributors and funders

Transparency is balanced with privacy and safety.

---

## 15. Review Cycle

This PMS Plan is reviewed:

- Annually
- After serious incidents
- Upon regulatory change
- Following major system upgrades

---

## 16. Foundational Statement

> **Deployment is not the end of responsibility.**  
> **Surveillance is continuous stewardship.**

---

### Status
**Post-Market Surveillance Plan – Active Draft**  
Applies to all NeuroGrid systems operating in live or pilot environments.
