# RPM_ALERT_ESCALATION_PLAYBOOK.md  
**Remote Patient Monitoring Alert Escalation & Response Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This playbook defines the **mandatory escalation logic, response actions, and accountability chain** for all alerts generated by Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) systems operating within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its objective is to:
- Prevent delayed or inappropriate responses
- Protect patient safety
- Ensure regulatory compliance
- Establish auditable responsibility at every escalation layer

This is an **operational safety document**, not a guideline.

---

## 2. Scope

This playbook applies to:
- AI-generated RPM alerts
- Rule-based physiological thresholds
- Hybrid AI-clinician review systems
- All RPM deployments using NeuroGrid infrastructure

It covers:
- Pre-clinical monitoring
- Active clinical monitoring
- Post-market surveillance contexts

---

## 3. Alert Escalation Principles

All escalation logic must comply with the following principles:

- **Time-Criticality Awareness**
- **Human-in-the-Loop Enforcement**
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**
- **Explainable Triggers**
- **No Silent Failures**

No alert may terminate without a documented resolution state.

---

## 4. Alert Classification Levels

### Level 0 – Informational
- Non-actionable trend data
- Logged for analysis only
- No escalation required

### Level 1 – Advisory
- Mild deviations from baseline
- Requires clinician review within defined SLA
- No immediate patient contact required

### Level 2 – Actionable
- Clinically relevant deviations
- Mandatory human review
- Patient contact recommended

### Level 3 – Urgent
- High-risk physiological patterns
- Immediate clinician intervention required
- Escalation to on-call medical staff

### Level 4 – Critical
- Life-threatening indicators
- Emergency protocol activation
- External emergency services engagement permitted

---

## 5. Escalation Chain of Responsibility

Alerts must follow this escalation hierarchy:

1. AI / Automated Detection Layer
2. Clinical Monitoring Staff
3. Supervising Clinician
4. Medical Director / Responsible Physician
5. Emergency Services (if applicable)

No escalation step may be skipped unless explicitly authorized by protocol.

---

## 6. Escalation Timeframes (SLA)

| Alert Level | Max Review Time | Max Action Time |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Level 1 | 24 hours | 48 hours |
| Level 2 | 4 hours | 8 hours |
| Level 3 | 15 minutes | Immediate |
| Level 4 | Immediate | Immediate |

Failure to meet SLAs triggers automatic compliance review.

---

## 7. Human Override & Validation

- AI alerts **must not self-resolve**
- Human acknowledgment is mandatory for Levels 2–4
- Overrides require justification
- All overrides are logged and auditable

Human judgment supersedes automation.

---

## 8. Patient Communication Protocol

When patient contact is required:
- Use approved communication channels
- Follow jurisdictional consent rules
- Document time, method, and outcome
- Escalate if patient is unreachable

No undocumented patient interaction is permitted.

---

## 9. False Positives & Alert Fatigue Management

To reduce alert fatigue:
- Periodic threshold reassessment
- Model performance review
- Clinician feedback loops
- Tiered alert prioritization

Suppression of alerts without review is prohibited.

---

## 10. System Failure & Degradation Handling

If RPM systems experience:
- Data loss
- Sensor malfunction
- AI model degradation

Then:
- Fail-safe escalation is triggered
- Clinicians are notified
- Monitoring status is downgraded
- Incident is logged for audit

System silence is treated as a risk event.

---

## 11. Documentation & Audit Logging

Each alert must include:
- Timestamp
- Trigger source
- Classification level
- Escalation actions taken
- Human reviewers involved
- Resolution outcome

Logs must be immutable and retained per regulatory timelines.

---

## 12. Regulatory Alignment

This playbook aligns with:
- FDA RPM guidance
- EU MDR vigilance requirements
- ANVISA post-market surveillance
- ISO 13485 / ISO 14971 risk controls
- LGPD / GDPR patient data protections

---

## 13. Training & Readiness

All personnel involved in RPM response must:
- Complete escalation training
- Pass annual competency reviews
- Acknowledge playbook updates

Untrained personnel may not participate in alert handling.

---

## 14. Incident Review & Continuous Improvement

After any Level 3 or Level 4 event:
- Mandatory post-incident review
- Root cause analysis
- Model and protocol reassessment
- Corrective actions documented

Learning is mandatory, not optional.

---

## 15. Ethical Position

> **An alert ignored is a risk accepted.  
> A risk accepted without consent is negligence.**

---

## 16. Review & Amendments

This playbook is reviewed:
- Quarterly
- After critical incidents
- Following regulatory updates
- Upon major model changes

Amendments require:
- Clinical leadership approval
- Ethics review
- Compliance sign-off

---

### Status
**Active – Mandatory Operational Control**

Applies to all NeuroGrid RPM systems, AI models, clinicians, and monitoring personnel.
