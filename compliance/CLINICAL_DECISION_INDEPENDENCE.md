# CLINICAL_DECISION_INDEPENDENCE.md
**Clinical Autonomy & Non-Interference Standard**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document establishes the **mandatory principle of clinical decision independence** within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its purpose is to ensure that:
- All clinical decisions remain under qualified human authority
- AI systems function strictly as decision-support tools
- Governance, funding, token mechanics, or automation do not influence clinical judgment
- Regulatory and ethical boundaries between computation and medicine are strictly enforced

Clinical autonomy is treated as a **non-negotiable safety and compliance requirement**.

---

## 2. Scope

This standard applies to:
- All clinicians interacting with NeuroGrid systems
- All AI-assisted clinical decision-support tools
- All Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) workflows
- All deployments involving patient-facing or clinician-facing outputs

It governs interactions across **MedIntel execution**, **DeSci governance**, and **Core auditability layers**.

---

## 3. Foundational Principle

> **No algorithm, DAO, incentive mechanism, or automated system may replace, coerce, or override a licensed clinician’s medical judgment.**

AI recommendations are advisory only and carry **no binding authority**.

---

## 4. Prohibited Interference Mechanisms

The following are strictly prohibited:

- Automated clinical decisions without human confirmation  
- Token-based incentives tied to clinical outcomes  
- Governance votes affecting individual patient care  
- AI-driven enforcement of treatment pathways  
- Penalization for clinician override of AI output  
- Financial, reputational, or access pressure on clinicians  

Any detected interference constitutes a **critical compliance breach**.

---

## 5. Permitted AI Support Functions

AI systems may be used to:
- Highlight trends and anomalies
- Provide risk assessments with confidence scores
- Surface relevant clinical literature
- Assist with workload prioritization
- Support documentation and audit logging

AI systems may **not**:
- Issue treatment orders
- Initiate irreversible clinical actions
- Suppress clinician dissent
- Enforce protocol adherence without discretion

---

## 6. Clinician Override Authority

Clinicians retain absolute authority to:
- Override AI recommendations
- Ignore system alerts
- Modify or halt AI-driven workflows
- Escalate outside system guidance

Overrides:
- Require no justification to governance bodies
- Must be logged for audit, not punishment
- Are protected from retaliation

---

## 7. Non-Retaliation Guarantee

No clinician may be:
- Penalized
- Investigated
- Demoted
- Excluded
- Financially disadvantaged

for decisions made in good faith that contradict AI output.

Any retaliation attempt triggers:
- Immediate ethics review
- Governance investigation
- Potential sanctions

---

## 8. Separation from Governance & Funding

Clinical decisions are **fully firewalled** from:
- DAO voting outcomes
- Token economics
- Funding allocation mechanisms
- Research incentives
- Contributor reputation systems

No governance action may influence live clinical care.

---

## 9. Audit & Accountability

All AI-clinician interactions must log:
- AI recommendation
- Confidence level
- Clinician action taken
- Timestamp
- Override status

Audit logs are:
- Immutable
- Pseudonymized
- Used for safety review only
- Never used for performance punishment

---

## 10. Failure & Fallback Conditions

If AI systems malfunction, degrade, or become unavailable:
- Clinical operations continue uninterrupted
- Manual clinical workflows take precedence
- AI outputs are suspended
- Incident reports are generated

No dependency on AI is permitted for patient safety.

---

## 11. Regulatory Alignment

This standard aligns with:
- FDA Clinical Decision Support (CDS) guidance
- EU MDR and EU AI Act human oversight requirements
- ISO 62304 clinical software standards
- WHO AI ethics in healthcare
- OECD AI governance principles

---

## 12. Ethical Position

> **Medicine is practiced by humans, not optimized by machines.**

AI exists to support clinicians, never to command them.

---

## 13. Binding Status

This document is:
- Mandatory across all NeuroGrid deployments
- Enforced through technical and governance safeguards
- Subject to ethics and compliance audits
- Amendable only via compliant governance processes

---
