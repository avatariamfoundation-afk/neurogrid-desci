**NeuroGrid DeSci Emergency Backup & Continuity Protocol**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **Emergency Backup Protocol** for the NeuroGrid DeSci layer.  
Its purpose is to ensure **continuity, integrity, and recoverability** of governance, registry, research, and compliance artifacts under adverse conditions.

Emergency backup is treated as a **governance and trust preservation control**, not merely an IT function.

---

## 2. Scope

This protocol applies to:
- Governance records
- DAO voting artifacts
- Registry entries and indices
- Policy and compliance documents
- Audit logs and transparency artifacts
- Research coordination metadata

It explicitly **excludes clinical operations**, which are governed by MedIntel emergency protocols.

---

## 3. Emergency Scenarios Covered

Emergency backup procedures apply during:
- Infrastructure failure
- Data corruption or loss
- Security breach
- Governance system compromise
- Jurisdictional or legal disruption
- Catastrophic operational outages

---

## 4. Backup Objectives

The DeSci emergency backup system ensures:
- No loss of governance history
- Preservation of registry immutability
- Restoration of DAO decision traceability
- Continuity of compliance evidence
- Verifiable recovery timelines

---

## 5. Backup Asset Classification

| Asset Category | Criticality |
|---------------|-------------|
| Governance Records | Critical |
| Registry Indices | Critical |
| Policy Documents | High |
| Audit Logs | Critical |
| Research Metadata | High |
| Transparency Artifacts | High |

Critical assets require redundant and geographically separated backups.

---

## 6. Backup Frequency

- Governance and registry data: Continuous or near-real-time
- Audit logs: Continuous append-only backup
- Policy documents: On change + scheduled snapshots
- Research metadata: Scheduled backups

Backup schedules may not be relaxed by governance vote.

---

## 7. Backup Integrity Controls

All backups must:
- Be cryptographically verifiable
- Preserve original timestamps
- Maintain version lineage
- Be tamper-evident

Unverifiable back
