**NeuroGrid DeSci – Clinical Scope & Use Boundary Declaration**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document formally defines the **intended clinical use**, **functional boundaries**, and **explicit exclusions** of all Clinical AI systems developed, deployed, or governed under the NeuroGrid DeSci ecosystem.

This statement is designed to:
- Satisfy medical device and AI regulatory requirements
- Prevent scope creep into unauthorized clinical decision-making
- Ensure patient safety and clinician accountability
- Provide legal clarity for regulators, partners, and contributors

This document is binding across **all deployments, jurisdictions, and DAO-governed activities**.

---

## 2. Definition of Clinical AI within NeuroGrid

For the purpose of this framework, **Clinical AI** refers to:

> Software-based systems that analyze health-related data to generate **risk signals, trend insights, or decision-support information** intended to assist licensed healthcare professionals.

NeuroGrid Clinical AI systems are **supportive**, not authoritative.

---

## 3. Intended Use (What the AI *Is* Designed to Do)

NeuroGrid Clinical AI is intended to:

- Analyze physiological, behavioral, or biometric data streams
- Detect statistically significant deviations from patient-specific baselines
- Generate alerts, risk scores, or prioritization flags
- Support clinical workflow efficiency
- Assist post-operative and chronic condition monitoring
- Provide longitudinal trend analysis
- Enable early identification of potential adverse events

All outputs are **advisory** and **non-binding**.

---

## 4. Intended Users

NeuroGrid Clinical AI is intended for use **exclusively by**:

- Licensed physicians
- Registered nurses
- Certified allied healthcare professionals
- Authorized clinical researchers
- Clinical operations teams under medical supervision

It is **not intended for direct patient self-diagnosis or autonomous decision-making**.

---

## 5. Intended Clinical Settings

The system may be deployed in:

- Hospitals and clinics
- Post-operative monitoring programs
- Home-based RPM programs
- Telemedicine platforms
- Clinical research environments
- Academic medical centers

Deployment must align with local regulatory approval status.

---

## 6. Explicit Non-Intended Use (Prohibited Uses)

NeuroGrid Clinical AI **must not** be used for:

- Autonomous diagnosis
- Autonomous treatment selection
- Prescription generation
- Surgical decision-making
- Emergency medical decision replacement
- Life-critical closed-loop control
- Patient-facing clinical advice without clinician mediation
- Any use beyond approved regulatory classification

Violation of these boundaries constitutes a **critical compliance breach**.

---

## 7. Human-in-the-Loop Requirement

All NeuroGrid Clinical AI systems operate under a **mandatory Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) model**:

- AI outputs require clinician review
- Final decisions remain with licensed professionals
- Override, dismissal, or escalation decisions are logged
- AI cannot enforce actions

This requirement is non-negotiable.

---

## 8. Risk Classification Alignment

NeuroGrid aligns intended use with international risk frameworks:

| Framework | Classification |
|---------|---------------|
| EU MDR | Software as Medical Device (SaMD) |
| IMDRF | Clinical Decision Support (CDS) |
| FDA | Non-autonomous CDS |
| ISO 13485 | Regulated medical software |
| ISO 62304 | Software lifecycle compliance |

Final classification is jurisdiction-dependent.

---

## 9. Model Output Characteristics

AI outputs may include:

- Risk stratification levels
- Confidence-weighted alerts
- Trend deviation indicators
- Priority queues
- Explainability summaries

Outputs **do not** include:
- Definitive diagnoses
- Treatment instructions
- Clinical orders

---

## 10. Patient Disclosure Requirements

Patients must be informed that:

- AI is used as a support tool
- AI does not replace clinician judgment
- Human oversight is maintained
- AI limitations are disclosed

Disclosure language must meet local consent laws.

---

## 11. Change Control & Scope Enforcement

Any change to intended use requires:

- Formal impact assessment
- Regulatory re-evaluation
- Ethics review approval
- DAO governance authorization
- Updated documentation and disclosures

Unauthorized scope expansion is prohibited.

---

## 12. Accountability Statement

NeuroGrid affirms that:

- Clinical responsibility remains with healthcare providers
- AI systems operate within defined boundaries
- Safety supersedes performance optimization
- Compliance takes precedence over speed or innovation

---

## 13. Document Authority

This document supersedes all informal descriptions, marketing language, or external interpretations of NeuroGrid Clinical AI capabilities.
