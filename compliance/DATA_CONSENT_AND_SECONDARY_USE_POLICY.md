**Consent Governance & Secondary Data Use Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **Data Consent and Secondary Use Policy** for the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its purpose is to ensure that:

- All data use is grounded in lawful, informed consent or valid legal basis
- Secondary use of data is controlled, transparent, and ethically justified
- Clinical safety, privacy, and regulatory obligations are preserved
- Data reuse does not exceed the scope originally granted by the data subject

Consent is a **governance constraint**, not a procedural formality.

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:

- Patient-generated RPM data
- Clinical records and annotations
- AI training, validation, and evaluation datasets
- Research, analytics, and quality improvement activities
- Registry-linked and derived data assets

Both primary and secondary data uses are in scope.

---

## 3. Governing Principle

> **Data may only travel as far as consent allows.**

Secondary use must never silently expand original intent.

---

## 4. Consent Foundations

All data collection and use must be based on at least one of the following:

- Explicit informed consent
- Legal or regulatory obligation
- Public interest in healthcare
- Scientific research under approved safeguards

The lawful basis must be documented and auditable.

---

## 5. Consent Characteristics

Valid consent must be:

- Freely given
- Specific
- Informed
- Unambiguous
- Revocable

Bundled, implied, or coerced consent is invalid.

---

## 6. Consent Scope Definition

Consent records must specify:

- Data categories covered
- Intended primary use
- Permitted secondary uses (if any)
- Duration of consent
- Withdrawal mechanism
- Jurisdictional constraints

Undefined scope defaults to **no secondary use**.

---

## 7. Secondary Use Categories

Secondary use may include:

- Model improvement and validation
- Safety monitoring and bias analysis
- Aggregated research studies
- System performance analytics

Each category requires explicit consent or lawful justification.

---

## 8. Secondary Use Approval Controls

Secondary use requires:

- Consent scope verification
- Ethics review (where applicable)
- Compliance validation
- Registry documentation

Automated secondary use without approval is prohibited.

---

## 9. De-Identification & Minimization

Where secondary use is permitted:

- Data must be minimized to necessity
- De-identification or anonymization applied where possible
- Re-identification risk must be assessed and mitigated

Anonymization must be irreversible to qualify.

---

## 10. AI & Model Training Constraints

For AI systems:

- Training datasets must map to consent scopes
- Mixed-consent datasets are prohibited unless fully compatible
- Consent withdrawal impacts future training only
- Provenance links must preserve consent lineage

Consent violations invalidate model eligibility.

---

## 11. Registry & Traceability

Consent and secondary use decisions must be:

- Linked to data provenance records
- Registered in the DeSci registry
- Traceable to datasets and model versions
- Auditable across time

Consent lineage is immutable.

---

## 12. Withdrawal Implications

Upon consent withdrawal:

- Future data collection ceases
- Secondary use is halted unless legally justified
- Existing use is reassessed under erasure policy
- Registry entries are updated

Withdrawal does not retroactively alter past lawful use.

---

## 13. Prohibited Practices

The following are forbidden:

- Assuming consent for secondary purposes
- Expanding use beyond declared scope
- Retroactive consent assignment
- Using consent ambiguity to justify reuse
- Commercial exploitation without explicit authorization

Violations constitute a privacy and ethics breach.

---

## 14. Audit & Enforcement

Compliance is enforced through:

- Periodic consent audits
- Secondary use reviews
- Incident escalation for violations
- Suspension of affected datasets or models

Audit failures trigger corrective action.

---

## 15. Regulatory Alignment

This policy aligns with:

- GDPR & LGPD consent requirements
- HIPAA privacy rule
- EU AI Act data governance
- ISO/IEC 27701 (privacy management)
- Research ethics standards

---

## 16. Ethical Position

> **Consent is not permission to experiment endlessly.  
> It is a boundary that must be respected continuously.**

Trust is maintained by restraint.

---
