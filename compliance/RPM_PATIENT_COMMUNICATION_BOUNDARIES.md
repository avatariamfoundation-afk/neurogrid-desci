**Patient Communication Limits, Safeguards & Ethical Controls for RPM Systems**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines **strict boundaries, permissions, and prohibitions** governing how Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) systems within the NeuroGrid ecosystem communicate with patients.

The objective is to:
- Protect patient autonomy and psychological safety
- Prevent over-reliance on automated systems
- Avoid medical misrepresentation
- Ensure regulatory and ethical compliance
- Preserve clinician authority in care delivery

RPM systems **support care** — they do not replace clinical judgment.

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:
- AI-generated notifications
- Automated alerts delivered to patients
- System-initiated messages (SMS, app, email, voice)
- Human-mediated communications triggered by RPM events

It applies across:
- Pre-operative
- Post-operative
- Chronic monitoring
- Research-based RPM deployments

---

## 3. Foundational Principles

All patient communications must adhere to:

- **Non-Diagnosis**
- **Non-Directive Framing**
- **Human-Centered Authority**
- **Minimal Psychological Load**
- **Transparency of System Limitations**

No communication may simulate a clinician.

---

## 4. Explicit Communication Prohibitions

RPM systems **must not**:

- Diagnose medical conditions
- Provide treatment instructions
- Predict outcomes or prognosis
- Use alarming or urgent language without clinician review
- Suggest medication changes
- Represent themselves as healthcare professionals
- Pressure patients into action
- Replace informed consent processes

Violations constitute critical compliance breaches.

---

## 5. Permitted Communication Categories

RPM systems **may communicate** only within these categories:

### A. Informational Status Updates
- Data received confirmation
- Monitoring active / inactive status
- Device connectivity notifications

### B. Neutral Observation Notices
- “A reading outside your usual range was detected”
- “Your care team has been notified”

### C. Procedural Instructions
- Device usage reminders
- Sensor placement guidance
- Data submission confirmations

### D. Escalation Notices
- Notification that a clinician will contact the patient
- Emergency escalation acknowledgments (non-directive)

---

## 6. Language & Tone Requirements

All communications must be:
- Neutral
- Non-alarming
- Non-interpretive
- Plain-language
- Emotionally conservative

### Prohibited Language Includes:
- “Danger”
- “Critical condition”
- “Immediate risk”
- “Failure”
- “Abnormal diagnosis”

---

## 7. Emergency Communication Boundaries

In potential emergency scenarios:
- The system may notify the patient that escalation has occurred
- The system may advise contacting emergency services **only if pre-approved and disclosed**
- The system must defer clinical explanation to human professionals

Emergency wording must be predefined and approved.

---

## 8. Consent & Disclosure Requirements

Patients must be informed:
- That communications are automated
- That messages are non-diagnostic
- That human clinicians remain responsible
- Of system limitations
- Of escalation protocols

Consent records must be maintained.

---

## 9. Cultural & Psychological Sensitivity

Communications must:
- Avoid culturally biased assumptions
- Avoid fear-based messaging
- Respect literacy and accessibility standards
- Be configurable for language and disability accommodations

---

## 10. Communication Frequency Controls

To prevent distress and fatigue:
- Rate limits must be enforced
- Repetitive notifications must be consolidated
- Non-urgent messages must be delayed if appropriate

Excessive communication is a safety risk.

---

## 11. Audit & Traceability

All patient-facing communications must be:
- Logged
- Timestamped
- Attributable to system or human origin
- Reviewable for compliance

Communication logs are subject to audit.

---

## 12. Model-Generated Content Safeguards

AI-generated messages:
- Must use pre-approved templates
- Must not generate free-form clinical language
- Must be constrained by rule-based guardrails

Unbounded generation is prohibited.

---

## 13. Incident Response

Any communication that:
- Causes patient distress
- Is misinterpreted as medical advice
- Violates boundaries

Must trigger:
- Incident logging
- Immediate review
- Corrective action
- Governance notification

---

## 14. Regulatory Alignment

This policy aligns with:
- FDA SaMD communication guidance
- EU MDR patient safety requirements
- ANVISA vigilance standards
- LGPD / GDPR transparency obligations
- ISO 62304 & ISO 14971

---

## 15. Ethical Position

> **Patients must never feel diagnosed by a machine  
> or abandoned to automation.**

Communication must reinforce trust, not authority.

---

## 16. Review & Amendment

Reviewed:
- Quarterly
- After communication incidents
- Following regulatory updates
- After model changes

Amendments require:
- Ethics approval
- Compliance sign-off
- Clinical validation

---

### Status
**Active – Mandatory Communication Boundary Control**

Applies to all NeuroGrid RPM deployments, AI models, and patient-facing interfaces.
