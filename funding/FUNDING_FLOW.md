**NeuroGrid DeSci Registry – Capital Allocation & Incentive Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines how funding is allocated, distributed, and governed within the NeuroGrid decentralized science (DeSci) ecosystem.

Funding exists to:
- Incentivize high-quality scientific contribution
- Sustain registry operations
- Align capital with ethical and scientific integrity
- Prevent extractive or speculative misuse of research outputs

NeuroGrid funding prioritizes **long-term scientific value over short-term yield**.

---

## 2. Funding Sources

Funding may originate from multiple sources, including but not limited to:

- DAO treasury allocations
- Protocol fees
- Research grants
- Institutional partnerships
- Public or private contributions
- Programmatic emissions (if applicable)

All funding sources are subject to registry transparency requirements.

---

## 3. Eligible Funding Categories

Funds may be allocated to the following categories:

### 3.1 Dataset Contributions
- High-quality, ethically sourced datasets
- Longitudinal or rare medical datasets
- Curated, annotated, or validated data collections

---

### 3.2 Model Development
- AI/ML models registered in NeuroGrid
- Federated or privacy-preserving architectures
- Clinically relevant or research-grade systems

---

### 3.3 Infrastructure & Tooling
- Open tooling that supports the registry
- Validation, audit, or interoperability tools
- Research reproducibility infrastructure

---

### 3.4 Research Outputs
- Peer-reviewed findings
- Whitepapers or formal studies
- Replication or validation work

---

### 3.5 Governance & Oversight
- DAO operations
- Ethics review processes
- Compliance tooling

---

## 4. Funding Eligibility Requirements

To qualify for funding, a submission must:

- Be fully registered in the NeuroGrid registry
- Comply with all dataset and model policies
- Include complete attribution metadata
- Pass ethics and compliance review (where required)
- Align with NeuroGrid’s stated research scope

Incomplete or non-compliant submissions are ineligible.

---

## 5. Funding Request Process

### 5.1 Submission
Funding requests must include:
- Registry reference ID(s)
- Clear description of contribution
- Requested funding amount or range
- Intended use of funds
- Milestones (if applicable)

---

### 5.2 Review
Requests may be evaluated based on:
- Scientific merit
- Ethical integrity
- Impact potential
- Reusability
- Alignment with registry priorities

---

### 5.3 Approval
Approvals may be granted via:
- DAO vote
- Committee mandate
- Automated rule-based mechanisms

Approval pathways are transparent and auditable.

---

## 6. Funding Distribution Mechanisms

Funding may be distributed through:

- Direct grants
- Milestone-based releases
- Streaming payments
- Retroactive funding (impact-based)
- Programmatic incentive pools

Mechanisms are selected to minimize misuse and maximize accountability.

---

## 7. Retroactive & Impact-Based Funding

NeuroGrid supports retroactive funding for contributions that:

- Demonstrate measurable downstream impact
- Are widely reused or cited
- Enable derivative research or applications

Impact assessment may include:
- On-chain metrics
- Registry usage signals
- Governance evaluation

---

## 8. Attribution-Linked Funding

Funding flows are tightly coupled to attribution:

- Funding is distributed proportionally to credited contributors
- Derivative works must share downstream funding
- Attribution disputes may pause funding distribution

This ensures fair compensation across research lineages.

---

## 9. Misuse, Clawbacks & Sanctions

Funding may be:
- Paused
- Revoked
- Clawed back

If evidence emerges of:
- Fraud
- Misrepresentation
- Ethical violations
- Policy non-compliance

Sanctions follow governance review.

---

## 10. Transparency & Reporting

All funding actions are:
- Logged
- Auditable
- Publicly referenceable (where legally permissible)

Recipients may be required to provide:
- Progress reports
- Outcome disclosures
- Use-of-funds summaries

---

## 11. Legal & Regulatory Alignment

Funding operations align with:
- Research grant standards
- Financial compliance requirements
- Jurisdictional regulations
- DAO treasury governance norms

NeuroGrid does not facilitate unlawful financial activity.

---

## 12. Foundational Principle

> **Funding is a signal of trust, not entitlement.**  
>  
> Capital follows integrity, impact, and accountability.

---

### Status
**Registry Policy – Active Draft**  
Subject to DAO ratification and iterative governance updates.
