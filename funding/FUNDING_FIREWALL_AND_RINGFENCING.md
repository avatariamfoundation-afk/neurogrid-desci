# FUNDING_FIREWALL_AND_RINGFENCING.md
Capital Segregation, Integrity & Misallocation Prevention Framework

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **mandatory funding firewall and ring-fencing controls** governing all financial flows within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its objectives are to:
- Prevent cross-subsidization between unrelated activities
- Protect clinical, safety, and research funds from misuse
- Ensure donor, grantor, and treasury intent is honored
- Preserve regulatory, ethical, and audit integrity

Funding segregation is treated as a **compliance and safety control**, not an accounting preference.

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:
- All DAO treasuries and sub-treasuries
- Grant funding and research allocations
- Clinical safety and compliance budgets
- Emergency reserves
- Operational and infrastructure funding

It applies across **Core enforcement**, **MedIntel execution**, and **DeSci governance** layers.

---

## 3. Definitions

- **Funding Firewall:** A technical and procedural barrier preventing funds from being accessed outside their authorized purpose.
- **Ring-Fencing:** The strict allocation of funds to a defined use-case, time horizon, and authority set.
- **Misallocation:** Any use of funds outside their approved scope, intent, or conditions.

---

## 4. Mandatory Ring-Fencing Categories

All funds must be assigned to one of the following categories at receipt:

1. Clinical Safety & Compliance  
2. Research & DeSci Grants  
3. Infrastructure & Operations  
4. Emergency & Contingency Reserves  
5. Governance & Oversight  

Funds may not be reclassified without formal approval.

---

## 5. Firewall Implementation Requirements

Funding firewalls must be enforced through:
- Separate on-chain wallets or accounts
- Explicit smart contract restrictions
- Role-based access controls
- Purpose-bound disbursement rules
- Immutable allocation metadata

Commingled funding pools are prohibited.

---

## 6. Authorized Access Controls

Each funding pool must define:
- Authorized signatories
- Spending thresholds
- Approval requirements
- Permitted expense categories
- Time-bound access windows

No individual may unilaterally control multiple critical pools.

---

## 7. Prohibited Practices

The following are strictly forbidden:
- Temporary borrowing between pools
- Emergency overrides without documentation
- Retroactive reclassification of expenses
- Informal reimbursements across categories
- Obscured or indirect fund transfers

Violations trigger immediate investigation.

---

## 8. Change & Reallocation Process

Any reallocation requires:
1. Formal proposal submission
2. Impact and risk assessment
3. Governance approval
4. Public disclosure
5. Updated firewall rules

Emergency reallocations require post-hoc ratification.

---

## 9. Audit & Transparency

All funding actions must be:
- Logged immutably
- Traceable to source and purpose
- Publicly auditable at aggregate level
- Subject to periodic independent audit

Clinical and safety funds receive priority audit review.

---

## 10. Incident Response

If a firewall breach is detected:
- Immediate fund freeze
- Scope and impact assessment
- Governance and compliance notification
- Corrective action and restitution
- Sanctions or remediation as applicable

Patient safety and research integrity take precedence.

---

## 11. Regulatory Alignment

This policy aligns with:
- ISO 37000 governance standards
- OECD public funding integrity principles
- EU grant and research compliance expectations
- Clinical trial funding segregation norms
- DAO transparency and fiduciary best practices

---

## 12. Ethical Position

> **Funds entrusted for safety, science, or care must never be diluted by convenience.**

Ring-fencing preserves trust, intent, and accountability.

---

## 13. Binding Status

This document is:
- Mandatory across all NeuroGrid funding activities
- Enforced through technical and governance controls
- Subject to independent audit
- Amendable only via approved governance process
