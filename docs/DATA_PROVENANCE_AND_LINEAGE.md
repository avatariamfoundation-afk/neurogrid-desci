**Data Origin, Traceability & Integrity Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **Data Provenance and Lineage framework** for the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its purpose is to ensure that all data used, processed, or generated by NeuroGrid systems:

- Has a verifiable and transparent origin
- Maintains an unbroken chain of custody
- Is traceable across transformations and uses
- Supports auditability, accountability, and regulatory compliance

In clinical systems, **unknown data lineage is an unacceptable risk**.

---

## 2. Scope

This framework applies to all data categories, including:

- Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) sensor data
- Clinical annotations and clinician inputs
- AI training, validation, and inference datasets
- Model outputs, alerts, and recommendations
- Governance, registry, and audit metadata

Both on-chain and off-chain data assets are in scope.

---

## 3. Core Principle

> **If data origin cannot be proven, the data cannot be trusted.**

Trust in AI outputs is inseparable from trust in the data that produced them.

---

## 4. Data Provenance Definition

Data provenance refers to the ability to determine:

- Where data originated
- How it was collected
- Under what consent and legal basis
- Who handled or modified it
- For what purpose it was used

Provenance must be explicit, not inferred.

---

## 5. Data Lineage Definition

Data lineage captures the **lifecycle of data**, including:

- Collection
- Ingestion
- Transformation
- Aggregation
- Model consumption
- Output generation
- Archival or deletion

Each transformation step must be traceable and attributable.

---

## 6. Provenance Metadata Requirements

All data assets must be accompanied by metadata including:

- Data source identifier
- Collection method and device (if applicable)
- Timestamp and timezone
- Consent reference and scope
- Jurisdictional origin
- Data controller and processor roles
- Integrity checksum or hash reference

Missing metadata renders data non-compliant.

---

## 7. Lineage Tracking Controls

Lineage tracking must:

- Record each processing step
- Preserve parent–child data relationships
- Prevent silent data mutation
- Support reconstruction of historical states

Lineage records must be immutable once committed.

---

## 8. On-Chain / Off-Chain Coordination

Due to data sensitivity and scale:

- Raw clinical data remains off-chain
- Provenance hashes, identifiers, and summaries are anchored on-chain
- Lineage references link off-chain assets to on-chain attestations

On-chain records serve as **tamper-evident anchors**, not data stores.

---

## 9. AI-Specific Lineage Obligations

For AI systems, lineage must explicitly link:

- Training datasets to model versions
- Validation datasets to approval decisions
- Inference inputs to generated outputs
- Outputs to downstream clinical or operational actions

No model output may exist without traceable input lineage.

---

## 10. Access & Modification Controls

Only authorized roles may:

- Ingest new data
- Transform existing data
- Annotate or label data
- Decommission data assets

All access and modifications must be logged and attributable.

---

## 11. Audit & Inspection Readiness

Provenance and lineage records must support:

- Regulatory inspections
- Incident investigations
- Bias and drift analysis
- Model change impact assessments
- Legal and compliance audits

Inability to reconstruct lineage is treated as a compliance failure.

---

## 12. Retention & Immutability

- Provenance and lineage metadata must be retained indefinitely
- Deletion of raw data must not delete lineage records
- Historical lineage must remain queryable after model retirement

Retention rules override convenience.

---

## 13. Incident Handling

If provenance or lineage integrity is compromised:

- A data integrity incident is declared
- Affected datasets are quarantined
- Dependent models are reviewed
- Registry entries are updated
- Corrective actions are documented

Silent remediation is prohibited.

---

## 14. Prohibited Practices

The following are forbidden:

- Using data with unknown or unverifiable origin
- Retroactively assigning provenance
- Overwriting lineage records
- Mixing datasets with incompatible consent scopes
- Reusing data beyond its declared purpose

Violations constitute a system integrity breach.

---

## 15. Regulatory Alignment

This framework aligns with:

- GDPR & LGPD (accountability and data governance)
- EU AI Act (data governance & traceability)
- FDA data integrity expectations
- ISO/IEC 27001 (information security)
- ISO/IEC 5259 series (AI data governance)

---

## 16. Ethical Position

> **Data without history is fiction.  
> Decisions built on fiction are harm.**

Provenance is the memory that keeps systems honest.

---

### Status
**Active – Mandatory Data Governance Control**
