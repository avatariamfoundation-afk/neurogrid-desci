# DeSci: Decentralized Science Platform for Post-Operative Research on BNB Chain

DeSci enables collaborative, AI-enhanced scientific research on Web3, with secure data sharing for post-operative care. Built for BNB Chain hackathon, it's the science engine of the Avatariam Foundation AFK ecosystem, supporting verifiable computation, biomed data layers, and human-machine co-labs.

## Features
- Contracts for research data management in post-op studies.
- AI for hypothesis testing and reproducibility.
- P2P for global collaboration on recovery research.
- Open-data knowledge graphs for biomedical insights.
- Federation of research agents and bridges to Aethera BioSync.

## Quick Start
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/avatariamfoundation-afk/desci.git`
2. Install: `npm install` (and `pip install requests python-dotenv` for AI)
3. Configure: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in keys.
4. Deploy contracts: `npm run deploy`
5. Start API: `npm start`
6. Demo: `npm run demo` and open http://localhost:8080

## Demo
Live demo: [link-to-deployed-demo] (e.g., on BNB Testnet). Test research verification and data sharing.

## API
See `docs/api.md` for endpoints on research and computation.

## Testing
- API: `npm run test-api`
- Contracts: `npm test`
- Lint: `npm run lint`

## Security and Compliance
- Encrypted data and ZKPs.
- Audit logs for reproducibility.
- Alignment with scientific and biomedical standards.

## Future Roadmap
- Full bridges to Aethera BioSync.
- Advanced human-machine co-labs.
- Global federation of research networks.

## Contributing
Open issues or PRs. Built by Aethera BioSync NeuroGrid.
