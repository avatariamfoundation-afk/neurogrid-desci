# DAO_SANCTION_APPEALS_FRAMEWORK
NeuroGrid-DeSci Governance Layer

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the formal appeals framework for sanctions imposed by the NeuroGrid DAO. It ensures due process, proportionality, transparency, and regulatory-aligned accountability while preserving DAO authority and system integrity.

Appeals are a **controlled governance mechanism**, not an entitlement.

---

## 2. Scope
This framework applies to sanctions issued against:
- DAO members
- Governance participants
- Committee members
- Contributors with delegated authority
- Fund recipients and research leads

It applies to sanctions originating from:
- Governance votes
- Ethics or compliance findings
- Independent Oversight determinations
- Emergency safety triggers

---

## 3. Appealable Sanctions
The following sanctions may be appealed:
- Suspension of voting rights
- Temporary role removal
- Funding freezes
- Research access restrictions
- Reputation or standing penalties

The following sanctions are **non-appealable**:
- Sanctions required by law or regulator
- Emergency safety actions involving patient risk
- Cryptographic key revocations following verified compromise

---

## 4. Appeal Eligibility
An appellant must:
- Be the directly sanctioned party
- Submit the appeal within the defined window
- Provide new evidence or procedural challenge
- Be in compliance with disclosure requirements

Frivolous or bad-faith appeals are grounds for escalation.

---

## 5. Appeal Submission Process
Appeals must be submitted:
- Within **14 days** of sanction notification
- Via the designated governance interface
- With a signed statement of grounds for appeal

Required components:
- Sanction reference ID
- Grounds for appeal (procedural, evidentiary, proportionality)
- Supporting documentation
- Conflict-of-interest declaration

---

## 6. Review Authority
Appeals are reviewed by:
- Independent Oversight Committee (primary)
- Ethics Committee (if ethical breach involved)
- Compliance Committee (if regulatory exposure exists)

No individual or body involved in the original sanction may adjudicate the appeal.

---

## 7. Appeal Evaluation Criteria
Appeals are assessed against:
- Procedural correctness
- Evidence integrity
- Proportionality of sanction
- Alignment with DAO policies
- Risk to patients, research, or data integrity

The burden of proof rests with the appellant.

---

## 8. Possible Outcomes
Following review, the reviewing body may:
- Uphold the sanction
- Modify the sanction
- Suspend the sanction pending remediation
- Overturn the sanction in full

Decisions are final unless escalated under Section 9.

---

## 9. Escalation and Final Review
Escalation is permitted only when:
- New material evidence emerges
- Procedural violations are substantiated
- Regulatory conflict is identified

Final escalation authority:
- Full DAO vote with enhanced quorum
- Subject to timelock and disclosure requirements

---

## 10. Timelines
- Initial review acknowledgment: 3 days
- Full review period: 21 days
- Final determination publication: 5 days post-decision

Failure to meet timelines must be documented and justified.

---

## 11. Transparency and Recordkeeping
All appeals must be:
- Logged on-chain (where applicable)
- Archived in governance records
- Redacted where legally required
- Included in annual governance reporting

---

## 12. Abuse Prevention
Repeated or malicious appeals may result in:
- Appeal privilege suspension
- Escalated sanctions
- Governance access restrictions

This safeguard protects DAO operational continuity.

---

## 13. Regulatory and Ethical Alignment
The appeals process must:
- Respect due process standards
- Maintain compliance with LGPD, GDPR, HIPAA where applicable
- Preserve patient safety and research integrity
- Avoid retaliatory or suppressive practices

---

## 14. Amendment and Review
This framework:
- Is reviewed annually
- Requires DAO proposal for amendment
- Requires supermajority approval
- Cannot be bypassed by emergency action

---

## 15. Binding Effect
This framework is binding across all NeuroGrid-DeSci governance activities and supersedes informal dispute resolution mechanisms.

Non-compliance constitutes a governance violation.
