## 5. Initiation of Removal Proceedings

No removal may occur without documented due process.

---

## 7. Emergency Suspension

In cases of immediate risk:

- Safety Council or Emergency Operators may impose **temporary suspension**
- DAO vote must follow within 72 hours
- Emergency actions are logged and disclosed

Emergency suspension does **not** imply guilt.

---

## 8. Voting Requirements

| Action Type        | Required Approval |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Warning           | Simple majority  |
| Suspension        | Simple majority  |
| Removal           | ≥ 60% quorum     |

Affected member may not vote on their own case.

---

## 9. On-Chain Recordkeeping

All actions are recorded with:

- Member identifier

- Effective date

Records are immutable and auditable.

---

## 10. Appeals Process

Removed members may file **one appeal** if:

- New evidence emerges

Appeals must be filed within 30 days.

---

## 11. Post-Removal Consequences

Removal may include:

- Loss of voting rights
- Loss of governance privileges
- Termination of funded roles
- Revocation of delegation authority

Token ownership alone does not guarantee governance access.

---

## 12. Protection Against Abuse

This policy may not be used to:

- Silence dissent

Abusive removal attempts are themselves violations.

---

- ISO governance standards

---

## 14. Ethical Position
