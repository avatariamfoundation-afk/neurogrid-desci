**Governance Decision-Making & Control Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **formal voting mechanism** governing the NeuroGrid DAO.  
It establishes how decisions are proposed, evaluated, voted on, ratified, and enforced in a manner that prioritizes:

- Patient safety
- Regulatory compliance
- Scientific integrity
- Long-term system stability

Voting is not a popularity contest; it is a **risk-weighted governance instrument**.

---

## 2. Scope

This mechanism applies to all DAO-governed decisions, including but not limited to:

- Model approvals and retirement
- Funding allocations
- Policy amendments
- Governance role changes
- Emergency protocol ratification
- Registry updates
- Compliance-bound decisions

Certain decisions are explicitly restricted (see Section 11).

---

## 3. Governance Philosophy

The DAO operates under the principle of **Qualified Decentralization**:

> Authority is decentralized, but not unbounded.  
> Expertise, accountability, and safety override raw voting power.

---

## 4. Voting Classes

DAO participants are grouped into **voting classes** with distinct privileges.

### A. Core Governance Members
- Long-term stewards
- Full proposal and voting rights
- Required for quorum on critical votes

### B. Domain Experts
- Clinical, technical, regulatory specialists
- Weighted input on domain-specific proposals

### C. Contributors
- Researchers, developers, data contributors
- Limited voting rights
- No unilateral authority

### D. Observers
- Read-only access
- No voting power

---

## 5. Proposal Types

### Type I – Informational
- No vote required
- Logged for transparency

### Type II – Operational
- Standard DAO vote
- Simple or supermajority required

### Type III – High-Risk / Regulated
- Safety, clinical, or compliance impact
- Requires:
  - Expert endorsement
  - Supermajority approval
  - Compliance validation

### Type IV – Emergency Ratification
- Post-action validation of emergency powers
- Time-bound vote

---

## 6. Proposal Lifecycle

1. Proposal submission
2. Preliminary compliance screening
3. Public review period
4. Expert commentary window
5. Voting window
6. Outcome ratification
7. Immutable record storage

No step may be skipped except during declared emergencies.

---

## 7. Quorum Requirements

| Proposal Type | Quorum |
|---------------|--------|
| Operational   | 51%    |
| High-Risk     | 66%    |
| Emergency     | 50% + Safety Council confirmation |

Votes without quorum are invalid.

---

## 8. Voting Weights

Voting weight is determined by:
- Governance role
- Domain relevance
- Compliance obligations

Token holdings **do not directly equal control**.

> Financial stake alone is insufficient authority in clinical systems.

---

## 9. Voting Methods

Supported mechanisms include:
- Single-choice majority
- Weighted expert voting
- Time-locked ballots
- Conditional approval votes

Quadratic voting may be used **only** for non-clinical matters.

---

## 10. Voting Transparency

All votes must record:
- Proposal ID
- Voting window
- Voter class
- Vote weight
- Final outcome

Anonymity is optional, but auditability is mandatory.

---

## 11. Restricted Decisions (Non-Votable)

The DAO may **not** vote to:
- Override patient safety protocols
- Disable emergency overrides
- Suppress adverse event reporting
- Alter regulatory obligations
- Bypass ethics review
- Conceal audit findings

These constraints are immutable.

---

## 12. Emergency Voting Mode

During declared emergencies:
- Voting windows may be shortened
- Safety Council may pre-act
- DAO vote ratifies or revokes actions post hoc

Emergency powers expire automatically.

---

## 13. Conflict of Interest Handling

Participants must disclose:
- Financial conflicts
- Research bias
- Commercial interest

Conflicted members:
- May comment
- May not vote on affected proposals

---

## 14. Vote Finality & Enforcement

Once ratified:
- Votes are binding
- Smart contracts enforce outcomes where applicable
- Reversal requires a higher approval threshold

---

## 15. Audit & Recordkeeping

All voting records are:
- Immutable
- Timestamped
- Publicly auditable
- Retained indefinitely

Tampering constitutes a governance breach.

---

## 16. Regulatory Alignment

This mechanism aligns with:
- EU AI Act governance expectations
- FDA GMLP oversight principles
- DAO legal frameworks
- ISO 37301 (Compliance Management)
- WHO AI governance guidance

---

## 17. Ethical Position

> **Decentralization without restraint is negligence.  
> Governance without expertise is abdication.**

The DAO exists to protect systems, people, and truth — not to dominate them.
