# DAO_PROPOSAL_CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md  
**Governance Proposal Typology, Risk Tiering & Decision Controls**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **official classification system** for all DAO proposals within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its purpose is to:
- Prevent unsafe or inappropriate governance actions
- Apply proportional scrutiny based on risk
- Ensure regulatory, ethical, and clinical safeguards
- Maintain decision traceability and accountability

No proposal may proceed without classification.

---

## 2. Core Principle

> **Not all proposals are equal. Governance power must scale with risk.**

Higher-risk proposals require:
- Greater scrutiny
- Longer review periods
- Higher voting thresholds
- Stronger oversight controls

---

## 3. Scope

This matrix applies to proposals affecting:
- Smart contracts
- AI models
- Clinical systems
- Data governance
- Token economics
- DAO structure and authority

---

## 4. Proposal Classification Levels

All proposals fall into **one of five classes**:

| Class | Name | Risk Level | Impact Scope |
|-----|------|----------|-------------|
| I | Informational | Minimal | Non-binding |
| II | Operational | Low | Internal processes |
| III | Technical | Moderate | System components |
| IV | Safety-Critical | High | Clinical or AI safety |
| V | Constitutional | Extreme | Governance authority |

---

## 5. Class I – Informational Proposals

**Description:**
- Reports
- Disclosures
- Transparency updates
- Research summaries

**Characteristics:**
- No execution authority
- No system changes
- No vote required (acknowledgment only)

**Examples:**
- Audit reports
- Post-incident summaries
- Research publications

---

## 6. Class II – Operational Proposals

**Description:**
- Process adjustments
- Documentation updates
- Non-clinical operational changes

**Risk Level:** Low

**Requirements:**
- Simple majority vote
- Short voting window
- No compliance escalation

**Examples:**
- DAO workflow updates
- Documentation standards
- Community initiatives

---

## 7. Class III – Technical Proposals

**Description:**
- Technical system changes without direct clinical impact

**Risk Level:** Moderate

**Requirements:**
- Supermajority vote
- Technical review required
- Auditability confirmation

**Examples:**
- Smart contract upgrades (non-core)
- Infrastructure changes
- Non-clinical AI pipeline updates

---

## 8. Class IV – Safety-Critical Proposals

**Description:**
- Proposals that may impact:
  - AI inference behavior
  - RPM alerting
  - Clinical decision support
  - Patient data handling

**Risk Level:** High

**Requirements:**
- Extended review period
- Safety and ethics review
- Human oversight confirmation
- High supermajority threshold

**Examples:**
- AI model threshold changes
- Alert escalation logic
- Data inclusion criteria for models

---

## 9. Class V – Constitutional Proposals

**Description:**
- Changes to DAO authority, scope, or limits

**Risk Level:** Extreme

**Requirements:**
- Longest review period
- Formal compliance review
- Legal and ethical assessment
- Highest voting threshold

**Examples:**
- DAO emergency powers modification
- Governance scope expansion
- Token governance authority changes

---

## 10. Classification Decision Matrix

| Proposal Impact | Classification |
|----------------|---------------|
| Informational only | Class I |
| Internal ops, no system impact | Class II |
| Technical, non-clinical | Class III |
| AI / clinical / patient risk | Class IV |
| Governance authority | Class V |

Misclassification is prohibited.

---

## 11. Reclassification Rules

A proposal must be **up-classed** if:
- New risks are identified
- Scope expands during review
- Regulatory implications emerge
- Clinical relevance becomes apparent

Down-classing requires justification and review.

---

## 12. Voting Thresholds

| Class | Voting Threshold |
|-----|----------------|
| I | None |
| II | >50% |
| III | ≥66% |
| IV | ≥75% |
| V | ≥85% |

Abstentions do not count toward approval.

---

## 13. Review Bodies by Class

| Class | Required Review |
|-----|----------------|
| I | None |
| II | DAO Ops Review |
| III | Technical Review Committee |
| IV | Ethics + Safety Oversight |
| V | Full Governance & Compliance Review |

---

## 14. Execution Constraints

- Class IV and V proposals may not auto-execute
- Human confirmation is mandatory
- Emergency override mechanisms apply
- Execution delays are enforced

---

## 15. Transparency & Disclosure

All proposals must include:
- Classification declaration
- Risk justification
- Review outcomes
- Voting results

Public disclosure is mandatory.

---

## 16. Prohibited Governance Actions

The following are prohibited:
- Bundling mixed-class proposals
- Fast-tracking safety-critical changes
- Retroactive classification
- Bypassing required reviews

---

## 17. Enforcement

Violations may result in:
- Proposal invalidation
- Governance sanctions
- Emergency suspension
- Regulatory notification

---

## 18. Regulatory Alignment

This framework aligns with:
- DAO governance best practices
- FDA risk-based controls
- EU MDR governance expectations
- AI Act proportional oversight principles

---

## 19. Amendment Rules

Changes to this matrix require:
- Class V proposal
- Full compliance review
- Public disclosure

---

## 20. Binding Status

This document is:
- Mandatory
- Enforceable
- Governance-critical
