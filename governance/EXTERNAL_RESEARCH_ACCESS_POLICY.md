# EXTERNAL RESEARCH ACCESS POLICY

## 1. PURPOSE
This policy defines the mandatory conditions, controls, and governance requirements under which external researchers may access DeSci repository data, models, or analytical outputs, ensuring scientific collaboration without compromising ethical, regulatory, or security obligations.

## 2. SCOPE
This policy applies to:
- Academic researchers
- Industry research partners
- Independent scientists
- Consortium members
- Non-DAO affiliated contributors

It covers access to:
- Research datasets
- AI models and outputs
- Analytical tools
- Aggregated or anonymized data products

## 3. ACCESS PRINCIPLES
External access is governed by the following principles:
- Least-privilege access
- Purpose limitation
- Data minimization
- Scientific transparency
- Full auditability

## 4. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS
External researchers must:
- Provide verifiable institutional or professional credentials
- Submit a documented research proposal
- Demonstrate ethical approval where applicable
- Agree to all governance and compliance terms

Access is denied where eligibility cannot be verified.

## 5. ACCESS REQUEST PROCESS
All access requests must include:
- Research purpose and objectives
- Specific data or model requirements
- Intended duration of access
- Data handling and security measures
- Disclosure and publication intent

Requests are reviewed and approved through DAO-governed processes.

## 6. DATA ACCESS CONTROLS

### 6.1 Permitted Access Types
- Read-only access
- Sandbox or isolated environments
- Aggregated or anonymized datasets
- Controlled query-based access

### 6.2 Prohibited Activities
External researchers may not:
- Attempt re-identification of individuals
- Redistribute data or models without approval
- Modify or retrain core models
- Circumvent access controls

## 7. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
- All access must occur through approved secure environments
- Encryption is mandatory for data in transit and at rest
- Session activity must be logged and monitored
- Access credentials are time-bound and revocable

## 8. AUDIT AND MONITORING
- All external access events must be logged
- Usage is subject to continuous monitoring
- Violations trigger immediate suspension and investigation

## 9. PUBLICATION AND ATTRIBUTION
External researchers must:
- Acknowledge DeSci repository contributions
- Submit publications for compliance review prior to release
- Share derived findings where required by agreement

## 10. TERMINATION OF ACCESS
Access is revoked upon:
- Completion of approved research period
- Breach of policy or agreement
- Withdrawal of consent or authorization
- Governance decision

All retrieved data must be securely deleted upon termination.

## 11. GOVERNANCE AND OVERSIGHT
- This policy is governed by DAO oversight mechanisms
- Policy amendments require formal approval
- Compliance reviews occur annually or upon regulatory change

- Legal or regulatory escalation
- Permanent exclusion from future access

## 13. VERSION CONTROL
All versions of this policy must be retained permanently with complete change history.
