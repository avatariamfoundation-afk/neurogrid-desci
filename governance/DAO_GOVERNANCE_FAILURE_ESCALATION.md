**Governance Failure Detection, Escalation & Containment Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **mandatory escalation, containment, and remediation procedures** for governance failures within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its objectives are to:
- Detect governance breakdowns early
- Prevent harm to clinical, scientific, or public trust
- Ensure decisive intervention pathways
- Preserve regulatory credibility
- Prevent systemic governance collapse

Governance failure handling is treated as a **safety-critical system**, not a reputational or political issue.

---

## 2. Scope

This framework applies to all governance structures operating within:

- NeuroGrid DAO
- Safety and ethics councils
- Funding and treasury governance
- Registry and approval committees
- Emergency authority mechanisms

It applies across **Core, MedIntel, and DeSci layers**.

---

## 3. Definition of Governance Failure

A governance failure is defined as any condition in which:

- Required decisions are blocked or indefinitely delayed
- Safety or ethics actions are ignored or overridden improperly
- Governance capture or coercion is detected
- Voting integrity is compromised
- Transparency obligations are violated
- Emergency powers are abused or withheld
- Regulatory compliance is endangered

Failure may be **procedural, structural, ethical, or systemic**.

---

## 4. Failure Classification Levels

### 4.1 Level 1 – Procedural Failure
Examples:
- Missed voting deadlines
- Incomplete disclosures
- Documentation lapses

Impact: Low  
Response: Administrative correction

---

### 4.2 Level 2 – Governance Integrity Failure
Examples:
- Quorum manipulation
- Conflict-of-interest violations
- Role abuse
- Improper proposal bundling

Impact: Moderate  
Response: Governance intervention

---

### 4.3 Level 3 – Safety or Ethics Failure
Examples:
- Ignored safety veto
- Ethics review bypass
- Unauthorized overrides
- RPM alert governance suppression

Impact: High  
Response: Immediate escalation

---

### 4.4 Level 4 – Systemic Governance Failure
Examples:
- DAO capture
- Coordinated manipulation
- Regulatory non-compliance exposure
- Persistent obstruction of corrective actions

Impact: Critical  
Response: Emergency containment

---

## 5. Failure Detection Mechanisms

Governance failures are detected via:
- Automated governance monitoring
- Transparency metric triggers
- Ethics or safety committee alerts
- Whistleblower reports
- External audit findings
- Regulatory inquiries

Detection sources are protected from retaliation.

---

## 6. Escalation Pathways

### 6.1 Internal Escalation
- Committee chair notification
- Safety or ethics council review
- Governance integrity assessment

### 6.2 Independent Oversight Escalation
Triggered when:
- Internal escalation is blocked
- Conflicts prevent resolution
- Safety risks persist

Independent oversight bodies gain temporary authority.

---

### 6.3 Emergency Escalation
Triggered immediately for:
- Level 3 or Level 4 failures
- Patient safety risks
- Regulatory breach risk

Emergency powers activate automatically.

---

## 7. Emergency Governance Controls

Emergency actions may include:
- Temporary suspension of voting
- Freezing of treasury actions
- Role suspensions or removals
- Model or registry holds
- Override of blocked decisions

Emergency controls are **time-limited and auditable**.

---

## 8. Decision Authority During Escalation

During escalation:
- Safety and ethics authorities supersede token voting
- Emergency councils operate independently
- Capital-weighted governance is suspended for safety matters

No single actor may exercise unilateral permanent control.

---

## 9. Communication & Disclosure

Mandatory disclosures include:
- Failure classification
- Impacted systems
- Actions taken
- Resolution status
- Preventive measures

Patient-identifiable or sensitive security data is never disclosed.

---

## 10. Resolution & Remediation

Resolution actions may include:
- Governance restructuring
- Role reassignment
- Rule amendments
- Sanctions enforcement
- Process redesign
- External audits

Remediation must address **root causes**, not symptoms.

---

## 11. Post-Incident Review

All governance failures require:
- Independent post-mortem analysis
- Public summary disclosure
- Preventive control updates
- Accountability assessment

Repeat failures trigger escalated sanctions.

---

## 12. Anti-Retaliation Protections

The following are strictly prohibited:
- Retaliation against reporters
- Suppression of escalation
- Obstruction of audits
- Threats or coercion

Violations result in immediate sanctions.

---

## 13. Regulatory Alignment

This framework aligns with:
- EU AI Act governance safeguards
- OECD institutional integrity standards
- Medical device post-market governance expectations
- ISO 37000 governance systems
- Clinical safety escalation norms

---

## 14. Review & Update Cycle

This policy is reviewed:
- Annually
- After any Level 3 or Level 4 incident
- Upon regulatory changes
- Following DAO structural revisions

---

## 15. Binding Status

This document is:
- Binding across all NeuroGrid DAOs
- Enforced through procedural and technical controls
- Amendable only via compliant governance processes
- Subject to independent audit
