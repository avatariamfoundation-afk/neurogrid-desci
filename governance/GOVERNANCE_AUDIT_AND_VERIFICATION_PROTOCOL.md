# GOVERNANCE_AUDITS_AND_VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md

## 1. Purpose
This protocol defines the mandatory audit and verification framework governing the NeuroGrid DAO. It ensures that governance actions, decisions, and processes remain compliant, verifiable, and aligned with clinical-grade accountability standards.

## 2. Scope
This protocol applies to:
- DAO voting processes and outcomes
- Committee and council decisions
- Emergency actions and vetoes
- Policy creation and amendments
- Role appointments and removals
- Compliance and ethics determinations
- Registry and funding decisions

All governance layers are in scope.

## 3. Audit Principles
Governance audits are governed by:
- Independence
- Objectivity
- Traceability
- Non-repudiation
- Regulatory defensibility

Governance without verification is invalid.

## 4. Audit Authority
Audits may be initiated by:
- Independent Oversight Committee
- Compliance Officer
- Safety Council
- External auditors (where authorized)
- Regulatory request

No governance body may audit itself.

## 5. Audit Types

### 5.1 Routine Audits
- Scheduled, periodic reviews
- Focus on procedural compliance
- Cover voting, recordkeeping, and role adherence

### 5.2 Triggered Audits
Initiated by:
- Incident reports
- Whistleblower disclosures
- Detected anomalies
- Governance challenges

### 5.3 Emergency Audits
- Immediate review following emergency powers usage
- Mandatory and non-deferrable

## 6. Audit Preparation
Each audit must define:
- Audit scope and objectives
- Time period under review
- Records and artifacts required
- Audit team composition

Audit scope is immutable once initiated.

## 7. Audit Inputs
Required inputs include:
- Governance records and logs
- Voting data and quorum verification
- Proposal documentation
- Conflict of interest disclosures
- Enforcement and escalation records

Missing records constitute an audit finding.

## 8. Verification Process
Verification includes:
- Cross-checking recorded decisions against rules
- Validating quorum and voting weight calculations
- Confirming role eligibility and authority
- Ensuring compliance with restricted-decision rules

Verification must be evidence-based.

## 9. Findings Classification
Audit findings are classified as:
- Compliant
- Minor non-conformance
- Major non-conformance
- Critical governance failure

Classification determines enforcement severity.

## 10. Audit Outcomes
Possible outcomes include:
- Formal compliance confirmation
- Required corrective actions
- Governance process remediation
- Role suspension or removal
- Escalation to regulators or external authorities

Outcomes are binding.

## 11. Corrective Action Plans
For non-compliant findings:
- Corrective actions must be defined
- Responsible parties assigned
- Deadlines enforced
- Completion verified

Failure to remediate escalates enforcement.

## 12. Transparency and Disclosure
Audit results:
- Are recorded immutably
- Are accessible to authorized stakeholders
- May be publicly disclosed where required

Concealment of findings is prohibited.

## 13. Protection of Audit Integrity
It is prohibited to:
- Influence auditors
- Retaliate against participants
- Alter or suppress evidence
- Delay mandated audits

Violations constitute severe governance breaches.

## 14. Record Retention
All audit materials are:
- Retained indefinitely
- Classified as permanent governance records
- Subject to legal hold where applicable

## 15. Regulatory Alignment
This protocol aligns with:
- ISO 37301 (Compliance Management Systems)
- EU AI Act governance and auditability
- FDA oversight and governance expectations
- DAO legal and fiduciary standards

## 16. Status
Active – Binding Governance Audit and Verification Protocol
