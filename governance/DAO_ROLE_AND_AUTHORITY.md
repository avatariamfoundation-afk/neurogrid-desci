Version: 1.0
Authority Level: Binding
Review Cycle: Annual or upon governance upgrade
Custodian: DAO Governance Council

1. Purpose

This document formally defines roles, authority boundaries, decision rights, and accountability structures within the NeuroGrid DAO. Its purpose is to ensure:

Clear separation between clinical, scientific, technical, and governance authority

Regulatory compliance (medical AI, clinical decision independence)

Prevention of authority ambiguity, governance capture, or DAO overreach

Auditability and enforceability of DAO decisions

2. Governance Principles

The DAO operates under the following non-negotiable principles:

Clinical Independence Supremacy
No DAO vote, token holder, or governance body may override licensed clinical judgment.

Separation of Powers
Governance, execution, validation, and oversight are structurally separated.

Least Authority Necessary
Roles are scoped to the minimum authority required.

Immutable Accountability
All role actions are logged, attributable, and auditable.

Regulatory Primacy
In conflicts between DAO preference and regulatory obligation, regulation prevails.

3. Role Taxonomy Overview

Roles are divided into four authority domains:

Governance Authority

Clinical Authority

Scientific / Technical Authority

Operational Authority

No individual or entity may simultaneously hold conflicting authority roles.

Absolute Independence:

Decisions are non-voteable by DAO

Immune to token-based governance pressure

5.2 Licensed Clinicians (End Users)

Interpretation of AI outputs

Override or ignore model recommendations

Protection Clause:
No DAO mechanism may penalize clinicians for independent judgment.

6. Scientific & Technical Roles

Oversee model lifecycle governance

Approve model updates

Validate performance metrics

Constraints:

Cannot approve deployment without clinical clearance

Cannot bypass post-market surveillance triggers

6.2 Data Custodians

Authority:

Manage anonymization and federated learning pipelines

Restrictions:

No governance voting rights

No clinical authority

7. Operational Roles

Maintain infrastructure uptime

Constraints:

No policy creation authority

No discretionary system changes

7.2 Audit & Transparency Officers

Verify role compliance

8. Authority Conflict Resolution

In the event of authority conflict, the following hierarchy applies:

Regulatory Law

Clinical Independence

Ethics & Compliance Rulings

Clinical Oversight Board

DAO Governance

Operational Execution

DAO votes are automatically invalidated if they violate higher-order authority.

9. Role Assignment & Revocation

Role assignment requires multi-sig approval

All roles have defined term limits

Emergency revocation is permitted for:

Regulatory breach
