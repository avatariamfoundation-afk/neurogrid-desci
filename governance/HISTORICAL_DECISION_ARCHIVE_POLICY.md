# HISTORICAL_DECISION_ARCHIVE_POLICY.md

## 1. PURPOSE
This policy defines the mandatory requirements for archiving, preserving, and accessing historical governance, scientific, clinical, and system decisions within the DeSci repository.

The archive exists to ensure institutional memory, accountability, auditability, and regulatory defensibility over the full lifecycle of the NeuroGrid system.

## 2. SCOPE
This policy applies to archival of:
- DAO governance decisions and votes
- Committee findings and resolutions
- Model approval, modification, and retirement decisions
- Data governance determinations
- Compliance and regulatory actions
- Emergency actions and post-hoc ratifications

All binding decisions must be archived.

## 3. ARCHIVAL PRINCIPLES
Historical decision archiving must be:
- Immutable
- Complete
- Chronologically ordered
- Context-preserving
- Publicly auditable where lawful

Loss of decision context is considered a governance failure.

## 4. DECISIONS SUBJECT TO ARCHIVING
The following must be archived without exception:
- Approved and rejected proposals
- Recorded votes and quorum confirmations
- Expert endorsements and dissenting opinions
- Oversight findings and escalations
- Enforcement and remediation actions

Informal or undocumented decisions are prohibited.

## 5. REQUIRED ARCHIVE METADATA
Each archived decision must include:
- Unique decision identifier
- Decision type and classification
- Decision-making body
- Date and timestamp
- Applicable policy references
- Outcome and enforcement status
- Linked artifacts and evidence

Incomplete records are non-compliant.

## 6. IMMUTABILITY AND INTEGRITY
Archived records must:
- Be write-once and tamper-resistant
- Include integrity verification mechanisms
- Be protected from deletion or alteration

Post-archive modification is prohibited.

## 7. VERSIONING AND SUPERSESSION
If a decision is superseded:
- The original decision remains archived
- Superseding decision must reference prior records
- Effective dates must be clearly documented

Historical revisionism is prohibited.

## 8. ACCESS AND TRANSPARENCY
Archived decisions must:
- Be accessible to authorized stakeholders
- Support public access where lawful and appropriate
- Enforce role-based access for sensitive content

Access restrictions must be justified and documented.

## 9. RETENTION PERIOD
Decision archives must be:
- Retained indefinitely unless legally prohibited
- Protected against accidental loss
- Included in backup and recovery controls

Premature deletion is a governance breach.

## 10. AUDIT AND OVERSIGHT
Historical archives are subject to:
- Periodic audit
- Oversight review
- Regulatory inspection

Missing or corrupted archives invalidate audit assurance.

## 11. INCIDENT HANDLING
If archival integrity is compromised:
- Immediate investigation is required
- Impact assessment must be performed
- Remediation actions must be documented
- Regulators must be notified where required

Archive compromise is a critical incident.

## 12. INTEROPERABILITY
Archived decisions must:
- Use standardized formats
- Support long-term readability
- Remain accessible across system upgrades

Proprietary lock-in is prohibited.

## 13. REGULATORY ALIGNMENT
This policy aligns with:
- EU AI Act governance traceability requirements
- FDA recordkeeping expectations
- ISO 37301 compliance management standards
- ISO 15489 records management principles

## 14. ENFORCEMENT
Violation of this policy may result in:
- Governance sanctions
- System access revocation
- Regulatory escalation if required
