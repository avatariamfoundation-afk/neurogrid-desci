# DAO_DECISION_TRACEABILITY.md  
**End-to-End Governance Decision Traceability Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **Decision Traceability Framework** for the NeuroGrid DAO.

Its purpose is to ensure that **every material governance decision** is:
- Traceable from origin to execution
- Auditable post hoc
- Defensible to regulators, auditors, and stakeholders
- Immutable once finalized

Decision traceability is treated as a **regulatory and ethical requirement**, not an optional transparency feature.

---

## 2. Scope

This framework applies to all DAO-mediated decisions, including but not limited to:
- Protocol upgrades
- AI model governance actions
- Dataset approvals or revocations
- Funding allocations
- Ethics and compliance rulings
- Emergency governance actions
- Token-related governance constraints

It applies across **Core, MedIntel, and DeSci** layers.

---

## 3. Definition of a Governance Decision

A governance decision is defined as **any DAO-approved action** that:
- Alters system behavior
- Changes risk posture
- Affects patient safety, data handling, or compliance
- Allocates capital or incentives
- Modifies governance rules themselves

Informal discussions and non-binding polls are excluded.

---

## 4. Traceability Principles

All DAO decisions must satisfy the following principles:

1. **Completeness** – All stages are recorded
2. **Integrity** – Records are tamper-resistant
3. **Attribution** – Roles are clearly defined
4. **Temporal Accuracy** – Time ordering is preserved
5. **Explainability** – Rationale is intelligible
6. **Auditability** – Independent reconstruction is possible

---

## 5. Decision Lifecycle Trace Map

Each decision must be traceable across the following lifecycle stages:

### 5.1 Initiation
- Proposal ID
- Proposer identity (or role)
- Submission timestamp
- Governance domain classification
- Risk category

---

### 5.2 Review & Analysis
- Ethics review outcome (if applicable)
- Compliance screening result
- Technical assessment summary
- Clinical review (for RPM/AI decisions)
- Identified risks and mitigations

---

### 5.3 Voting Phase
- Voting mechanism used
- Quorum requirements
- Voting window duration
- Participation metrics
- Vote weighting rules
- Abstentions and vetoes

---

### 5.4 Decision Outcome
- Final status (approved / rejected / modified)
- Timestamp of resolution
- Binding effect classification
- Conditional requirements (if any)

---

### 5.5 Execution
- Executing entity or smart contract
- Execution timestamp
- On-chain transaction hash (if applicable)
- Off-chain execution record (if applicable)

---

### 5.6 Post-Decision Review
- Implementation verification
- Compliance confirmation
- Impact assessment
- Incident linkage (if triggered)

---

## 6. Traceability Artifacts

Each decision must produce or reference the following artifacts:

| Artifact | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Proposal Record | Original governance submission |
| Review Logs | Ethics, compliance, technical reviews |
| Voting Record | Immutable voting data |
| Execution Proof | On-chain or off-chain execution evidence |
| Audit Trail | Aggregated trace record |

Artifacts must be retained according to data retention policies.

---

## 7. On-Chain vs Off-Chain Traceability

### 7.1 On-Chain Records
- Proposal IDs
- Vote tallies
- Execution transactions
- Governance state changes

### 7.2 Off-Chain Records
- Review documentation
- Risk assessments
- Clinical justifications
- Regulatory mappings

All off-chain records must be **cryptographically linked** to on-chain identifiers.

---

## 8. Decision Lineage & Dependency Tracking

Decisions must reference:
- Prior dependent decisions
- Superseded or revoked decisions
- Linked policies and frameworks

This ensures governance lineage and prevents contradictory rulings.

---

## 9. Accountability Model

Traceability assigns **responsibility, not blame**.

Each decision records:
- Proposer role
- Review authorities involved
- Voting bodies
- Execution authority

Personal data is minimized and role-based attribution is preferred.

---

## 10. Clinical & AI-Specific Traceability Requirements

For decisions affecting:
- AI models
- RPM systems
- Bio-cybernetic interfaces

Additional traceability is required:
- Model version references
- Dataset identifiers
- Risk classification
- Change control linkage
- Post-deployment monitoring hooks

---

## 11. Emergency Decisions

Emergency governance actions require:
- Explicit emergency flag
- Justification statement
- Time-limited validity
- Mandatory post-event review
- Enhanced disclosure requirements

Emergency decisions cannot bypass traceability requirements.

---

## 12. Audit & Verification

Decision traceability is subject to:
- Internal audits
- External audits
- Regulatory inspections
- Incident investigations

Failure to provide traceability is treated as a **governance breach**.

---

## 13. Transparency & Disclosure

Non-sensitive decision records are:
- Publicly accessible
- Indexed for searchability
- Referenced in transparency metrics

Sensitive data is redacted in accordance with privacy regulations.

---

## 14. Enforcement

Non-compliance with this framework may result in:
- Decision invalidation
- Governance process suspension
- Role revocation
- Mandatory corrective action

---

## 15. Regulatory Alignment

This framework aligns with:
- EU AI Act accountability requirements
- ISO 9001 traceability principles
- ISO 13485 quality records
- FDA design history file concepts
- OECD AI governance transparency guidelines

---

## 16. Ethical Position

> **If a decision cannot be traced, it cannot be trusted.**

Traceability is the foundation of legitimate decentralized governance.

---

## 17. Binding Status

This document is:
- Mandatory for all DAO decisions
- Enforceable through technical controls
- Subject to periodic review
- Amendable only via compliant governance procedures

---
