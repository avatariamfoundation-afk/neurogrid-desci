Governance Enforcement, Accountability & Corrective Action Framework

1. Purpose

This document defines the mandatory sanctions and remediation framework governing misconduct, non-compliance, and harmful actions within the NeuroGrid DAO ecosystem.

Its objectives are to:

Enforce accountability

Protect patient and system safety

Preserve governance integrity

Ensure proportional, documented enforcement

Prevent recurrence of harmful behavior

Sanctions are treated as a governance safety mechanism, not a punitive preference.

2. Scope

This framework applies to:

DAO members

Governance delegates

Committee members

Core, MedIntel, and DeSci contributors

Contractors and affiliated operators

It covers actions across:

Governance

Clinical AI operations

Data stewardship

Funding and treasury controls

Ethics and compliance systems

3. Foundational Enforcement Principles

NeuroGrid sanctions operate on five principles:

Proportionality – Sanctions match severity and impact

Due Process – Evidence-based, documented decisions

Safety Priority – Patient and system safety override all interests

Non-Retaliation – Protection for reporters and investigators

Remediation First – Correction is mandatory, not optional

4. Sanctionable Conduct

Sanctions may be imposed for:

Governance manipulation or vote coercion

Abuse of emergency or override powers

Clinical safety violations

AI model misuse or concealment of risk

Data misuse, suppression, or unauthorized access

Conflict of interest violations

Regulatory non-compliance

Malicious or negligent code deployment

Funding misappropriation

Repeated failure to implement corrective actions

Intentional, reckless, or concealed conduct is treated as aggravated.

5. Sanction Severity Levels
5.1 Level 1 – Corrective Sanctions

Applied for minor or first-time violations:

Formal warning

Mandatory retraining

Increased monitoring

Temporary role limitations

5.2 Level 2 – Restrictive Sanctions

Applied for serious or repeated violations:

Suspension of voting rights

Removal from governance roles

Loss of funding access

Revocation of override authority

5.3 Level 3 – Severe Sanctions

Applied for critical or malicious violations:

Permanent role removal

DAO membership expulsion

Token governance exclusion

Public disclosure of misconduct

Mandatory regulatory notification

6. Sanction Determination Process

All sanctions follow a defined process:

Incident identification

Evidence preservation

Independent review

Severity and impact assessment

Governance or safety council determination

Formal sanction resolution and documentation

Emergency safety sanctions may be enacted immediately.

7. Mandatory Remediation Requirements

Sanctions must include remediation actions, which may involve:

Technical fixes or model rollbacks

Clinical safety audits

Data correction or restoration

Policy or process redesign

Governance structure changes

Independent oversight or review

Sanctions are not considered closed until remediation is verified.

8. Enforcement & Execution

Once approved:

Sanctions take effect immediately

Enforcement is automated where possible

Actions are logged immutably

Non-compliance escalates sanction severity

No retroactive immunity is permitted.

9. Appeal Mechanism

Sanctioned parties may:

Submit one formal appeal

Provide new or overlooked evidence only

Adhere to defined submission timelines

Appeals do not suspend urgent safety-related sanctions.

10. Transparency & Disclosure

All sanctions and remediation outcomes:

Are logged in governance records

Are included in transparency reporting

May be publicly disclosed if safety-relevant

Patient-identifiable data is never disclosed.

11. Regulatory Coordination

Where applicable, sanctions trigger:

Regulatory notifications

Clinical authority engagement

External audits

Cross-border compliance actions

DAO governance does not override statutory obligations.

12. Non-Retaliation Protection

Retaliation against the following is strictly prohibited:

Whistleblowers

Investigators

Ethics or compliance officers

Clinicians raising safety concerns

Retaliation constitutes a sanctionable offense.

13. Review & Update Cycle

This framework is reviewed:

Annually

After major enforcement actions

Following regulatory changes

Upon governance restructuring

14. Binding Status

This document is:

Binding across all NeuroGrid DAOs

Enforced through technical and procedural controls

Amendable only via compliant governance processes

Subject to internal and external audit

Status
