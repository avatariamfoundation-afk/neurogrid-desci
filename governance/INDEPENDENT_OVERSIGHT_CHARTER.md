# GOVERNANCE_EMERGENCY_SAFETY_TRIGGER.md  
**Critical Safety Activation & Emergency Governance Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **mandatory emergency safety trigger mechanisms** governing when and how governance, clinical, or AI system emergencies are declared within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its objectives are to:
- Protect patient safety
- Prevent cascading system harm
- Enable rapid, controlled intervention
- Preserve regulatory compliance during crises

Emergency triggers are **protective mechanisms**, not governance shortcuts.

---

## 2. Scope

This framework applies to emergency conditions affecting:
- Clinical AI systems
- Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)
- DAO governance integrity
- Model deployment and behavior
- Data integrity and security
- Regulatory compliance status

It applies across **Core, MedIntel, and DeSci layers**.

---

## 3. Definition of an Emergency Safety Trigger

An **Emergency Safety Trigger (EST)** is a formally declared condition requiring immediate intervention due to a credible risk of:
- Patient harm
- Regulatory violation
- Systemic AI failure
- Governance capture or abuse
- Loss of operational control

Triggers override normal governance timelines but **do not bypass accountability**.

---

## 4. Trigger Activation Conditions

Emergency triggers may be activated under any of the following conditions:

### 4.1 Clinical Risk Triggers
- Credible evidence of patient harm or imminent risk
- Unsafe RPM alert behavior
- Incorrect or misleading clinical recommendations
- Loss of clinician override capability

---

### 4.2 AI System Risk Triggers
- Model drift exceeding safety thresholds
- Uncontrolled model behavior
- Explainability failure in safety-critical outputs
- Unauthorized model modification or deployment

---

### 4.3 Governance Risk Triggers
- Governance capture attempts
- Abuse of emergency powers
- Voting manipulation
- Loss of quorum integrity

---

### 4.4 Compliance & Regulatory Triggers
- Breach of medical device regulations
- Data protection violations
- Failure of required reporting obligations
- Regulatory enforcement actions

---

## 5. Authorized Trigger Initiators

Emergency triggers may be initiated by:
- Safety Council members
- Ethics Committee
- Clinical Oversight Authority
- Compliance Officers
- Designated Emergency Guardians

Single-party activation is permitted when delay increases risk.

---

## 6. Immediate Effects of Trigger Activation

Upon activation:
- Affected systems may be paused or restricted
- Model deployments are frozen
- Automated actions are suspended
- Emergency governance mode is enabled
- Incident logging is activated

All actions are time-bound and logged immutably.

---

## 7. Emergency Governance Mode

Emergency mode enforces:
- Narrowed decision scope
- Elevated transparency requirements
- Mandatory documentation of actions
- Continuous risk reassessment
- Temporary authority constraints

No permanent changes may be enacted under emergency mode.

---

## 8. Notification & Disclosure

Mandatory notifications include:
- Internal safety and governance bodies
- Affected operational teams
- Regulatory authorities (where required)

Public disclosure is required for:
- System-wide safety impacts
- Governance integrity events
- Material operational disruptions

Patient-identifiable data is never disclosed.

---

## 9. Deactivation & Recovery

Emergency status may be lifted only when:
- Risk conditions are resolved
- Independent verification is completed
- Corrective actions are documented
- Post-incident review is initiated

Deactivation requires multi-party confirmation.

---

## 10. Audit & Post-Incident Review

Every emergency trigger requires:
- Root cause analysis
- Timeline reconstruction
- Decision traceability
- Impact assessment
- Corrective and preventive actions

Findings are subject to independent audit.

---

## 11. Abuse Prevention

The following are prohibited:
- Repeated unjustified trigger activation
- Use of emergencies to bypass governance
- Suppression of reporting during emergencies
- Retaliation against trigger initiators

Abuse constitutes a governance violation.

---

## 12. Regulatory Alignment

This framework aligns with:
- FDA emergency safety protocols
- EU AI Act risk mitigation requirements
- ISO 14971 risk management
- Clinical governance best practices

---

## 13. Ethical Position

> **When safety is uncertain, intervention must be decisive, controlled, and accountable.**

---

## 14. Binding Status

This document is:
- Mandatory across all NeuroGrid governance entities
- Enforced through technical and procedural safeguards
- Subject to regulatory and independent audit
- Amendable only via compliant governance processes
