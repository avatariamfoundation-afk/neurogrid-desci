**Accountability, Traceability, and Public Trust Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **auditability and transparency requirements** governing all DAO operations within the NeuroGrid DeSci ecosystem.

Its purpose is to ensure:
- Verifiable decision-making
- Prevention of governance abuse
- Regulatory readiness
- Public trust in systems impacting healthcare, RPM, and bio-cybernetic applications

Transparency is a **non-optional safety control**, not a cosmetic feature.

---

## 2. Scope

This framework applies to:
- Token-governed funding decisions
- Research prioritization votes
- Governance proposals and amendments
- Emergency actions and overrides
- Ethics and compliance interactions
- DAO treasury and incentive flows

It covers **on-chain and off-chain governance components**.

---

## 3. Transparency Principles

All DAO operations must satisfy:

- **Public Verifiability** — Decisions must be independently verifiable
- **Traceability** — Every action is attributable to a process and timestamp
- **Explainability** — Outcomes must be human-readable and justifiable
- **Immutability** — Records cannot be altered retroactively
- **Proportional Disclosure** — Transparency without violating privacy laws

---

## 4. On-Chain Audit Requirements

The following must be recorded on-chain where feasible:

- Proposal creation metadata
- Voting parameters and eligibility rules
- Vote counts and weighting logic
- Final outcomes and execution status
- Treasury disbursements and recipients

Smart contracts must emit **audit-grade events** for all critical actions.

---

## 5. Off-Chain Governance Transparency

Where off-chain processes exist (e.g. ethics review, clinical oversight):

- Decisions must be logged with cryptographic hashes
- Records must be time-stamped and versioned
- References must be publicly accessible
- Any redactions must be justified and documented

Off-chain opacity is not permitted.

---

## 6. Independent Audits

### 6.1 Smart Contract Audits
- Conducted before mainnet deployment
- Repeated after material changes
- Findings published without suppression

### 6.2 Governance Process Audits
- Annual independent review
- Focus on vote integrity, capture risks, and emergency handling
- Reports made publicly available

---

## 7. Treasury & Funding Transparency

DAO-controlled funds must comply with:

- Public balance visibility
- Traceable fund flows
- Clear purpose tagging per transaction
- Post-allocation reporting requirements

No discretionary or opaque spending is permitted.

---

## 8. Conflict of Interest Disclosure

All DAO participants with voting or proposal rights must disclose:

- Financial interests
- Research affiliations
- Commercial ties
- Clinical or institutional relationships

Undisclosed conflicts invalidate governance participation.

---

## 9. Emergency Actions Transparency

Emergency overrides must include:

- Public declaration of emergency state
- Scope and duration of override
- Authority invoked
- Post-event audit report

Emergency powers are auditable, not secret.

---

## 10. Data Protection & Privacy Alignment

Transparency mechanisms must comply with:

- GDPR / LGPD data minimization
- Medical confidentiality standards
- Patient data anonymization
- Jurisdictional privacy laws

Auditability must never expose personal health data.

---

## 11. Tamper Resistance & Record Integrity

To ensure integrity:
- Logs must be append-only
- Hash-based verification is required
- Any correction requires a superseding record, not deletion

Historical truth is preserved.

---

## 12. Enforcement & Sanctions

Violations of audit or transparency requirements may result in:

- Proposal invalidation
- Governance rights suspension
- Treasury access revocation
- Public disclosure of violations
- Legal escalation if patient risk is involved

---

## 13. Ethical Position

> **A system that cannot be audited cannot be trusted.  
> A system that cannot be trusted must not govern healthcare.**

---

## 14. Review & Evolution

This framework is reviewed:
- Annually
- After security or governance incidents
- Following regulatory updates

Amendments require:
- Ethics approval
- Compliance review
- DAO ratification

---

### Status
**Active – Mandatory Governance Control**

Applies to all NeuroGrid DAO entities, contributors, and affiliated research systems.
