# GOVERNANCE_TRANSPARENCY_METRICS.md  
**Accountability, Visibility & Auditability Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **mandatory transparency metrics** governing all DAO, DeSci, and governance activities within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its objective is to ensure:
- Clear accountability
- Public auditability
- Regulatory trust
- Prevention of opaque or captured governance

Transparency is treated as a **safety and compliance requirement**, not a community preference.

---

## 2. Scope

These metrics apply to:

- DAO proposals and voting
- Funding allocation decisions
- Governance role assignments
- Emergency actions and overrides
- Ethics and compliance interventions
- Registry and dataset approvals

They apply across **Core, MedIntel, and DeSci layers**.

---

## 3. Core Transparency Principles

NeuroGrid governance operates on five principles:

1. **Traceability** – Every action has an attributable origin  
2. **Explainability** – Decisions must be understandable  
3. **Auditability** – Records must be reviewable and immutable  
4. **Timeliness** – Disclosures must be prompt  
5. **Non-Selective Disclosure** – No privileged visibility

---

## 4. Mandatory Transparency Metrics

### 4.1 Proposal Transparency
For every governance proposal:
- Unique proposal ID
- Proposer identity (pseudonymous allowed)
- Submission timestamp
- Scope classification (governance, funding, research)
- Safety classification
- Final outcome

### 4.2 Voting Transparency
For every vote:
- Total votes cast
- Quorum threshold
- Voting window duration
- Aggregate voting weights
- Final decision timestamp

Individual vote choices may remain pseudonymous, but **aggregate data is mandatory**.

### 4.3 Role & Authority Transparency
Public disclosure of:
- Governance roles
- Committee memberships
- Safety council composition
- Emergency authority holders
- Term durations

No hidden or informal authority structures are permitted.

---

## 5. Funding Transparency Metrics

All funding actions must disclose:
- Funding source
- Allocation amount
- Intended use
- Recipient entity (pseudonymous allowed)
- Milestone requirements
- Disbursement schedule

Clinical and safety funding must include additional justification logs.

---

## 6. Safety & Ethics Transparency

Mandatory disclosure of:
- Safety veto events (non-sensitive summary)
- Ethics committee holds
- Emergency overrides
- Model suspensions or retirements
- RPM alert system changes

Patient-identifiable data is **never disclosed**.

---

## 7. Registry & Data Transparency

Public metrics include:
- Number of registered datasets
- Number of approved models
- Dataset rejection rates
- Model version changes
- Attribution compliance status

Sensitive metadata remains access-controlled.

---

## 8. Incident & Exception Transparency

All governance-related incidents require:
- Incident classification
- Timestamp
- Affected systems
- Resolution status
- Corrective actions taken

Critical incidents trigger mandatory disclosures.

---

## 9. Update & Reporting Frequency

| Metric Category | Update Frequency |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Proposals & Votes | Real-time |
| Funding Actions | Within 24 hours |
| Safety Events | Immediate |
| Ethics Holds | Immediate |
| Registry Updates | Real-time |
| Audit Summaries | Quarterly |

---

## 10. Enforcement Mechanisms

Transparency is enforced through:
- On-chain event logging
- Immutable governance records
- Independent audit rights
- Automated disclosure triggers

Non-disclosure is treated as a governance violation.

---

## 11. Anti-Obfuscation Rules

The following are prohibited:
- Bundled or vague proposals
- Delayed disclosure tactics
- Off-chain shadow decisions
- Selective data visibility
- Obscured funding flows

Violations trigger audits and sanctions.

---

## 12. Regulatory Alignment

This framework aligns with:
- EU AI Act transparency requirements
- OECD AI governance principles
- FDA governance expectations
- ISO 37000 governance standards
- Open science best practices

---

## 13. Ethical Position

> **Trust is built when governance can be inspected, not assumed.**

Transparency is foundational to public confidence in AI-driven healthcare.

---

## 14. Binding Status

This document is:
- Binding across all NeuroGrid DAOs
- Enforced through technical and procedural controls
- Amendable only via compliant governance processes
- Subject to external audit
