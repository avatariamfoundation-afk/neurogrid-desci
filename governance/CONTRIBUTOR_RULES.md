**NeuroGrid DeSci Registry – Contributor Participation & Conduct Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the rules, responsibilities, and expectations for all contributors participating in the NeuroGrid decentralized science (DeSci) ecosystem.

NeuroGrid recognizes contributors as **stewards of scientific integrity**, not merely participants.  
These rules exist to preserve trust, attribution accuracy, ethical compliance, and long-term viability.

---

## 2. Definition of a Contributor

A *Contributor* is any entity that submits, references, or materially influences registry artifacts, including:

- Datasets
- Models
- Research outputs
- Methodologies
- Metadata attestations
- Governance proposals related to registry content

Contributors may be:
- Individuals
- Research teams
- Institutions
- DAOs or collectives
- Federated participants (where disclosure is permitted)

---

## 3. Contributor Eligibility

To contribute, an entity must:

- Have the legal and ethical right to submit referenced materials
- Agree to all registry policies
- Accept governance oversight
- Comply with applicable laws and research ethics standards

NeuroGrid does **not** require identity disclosure by default, but accountability is mandatory.

---

## 4. Contributor Obligations

All contributors must adhere to the following obligations.

### 4.1 Truthful Representation
Contributors must ensure that all submissions are:
- Accurate
- Complete
- Non-misleading
- Properly attributed

Knowingly false or deceptive submissions constitute a governance breach.

---

### 4.2 Lawful & Ethical Data Use
Contributors must ensure that:
- No prohibited, unlawfully obtained, or non-consensual data is referenced
- Dataset policies are respected
- Sensitive data constraints are honored

Ethical compliance is **non-negotiable**.

---

### 4.3 Attribution Integrity
Contributors must:
- Credit all upstream contributors
- Declare derivative relationships
- Avoid attribution laundering or omission

Attribution manipulation is treated as misconduct.

---

### 4.4 Transparency of Limitations
Where applicable, contributors must disclose:
- Known biases
- Model limitations
- Data constraints
- Intended and prohibited use cases

Silence on known risks is considered negligent.

---

## 5. Prohibited Conduct

The following actions are explicitly prohibited:

- Submitting plagiarized or misattributed work
- Referencing unregistered or undisclosed datasets
- Falsifying lineage, performance, or provenance
- Circumventing governance processes
- Attempting to retroactively alter registry records
- Using NeuroGrid artifacts for undisclosed harmful purposes

Violations may trigger sanctions.

---

## 6. Contributor Rights

Contributors retain the right to:

- Be accurately credited for their work
- Submit corrections or clarifications
- Participate in governance discussions
- Appeal registry decisions
- Withdraw future participation (past records remain immutable)

NeuroGrid does not claim ownership over contributor work.

---

## 7. Registry Immutability & Corrections

### 7.1 Immutability Principle
Once recorded:
- Registry entries cannot be deleted or altered
- Historical integrity is preserved

### 7.2 Corrections
Errors must be addressed via:
- Additive correction records
- Explicit annotations
- Governance-reviewed updates

Transparency overrides revisionism.

---

## 8. Incentives & Recognition

Eligibility for:
- Funding flows
- DAO incentives
- Reputation scoring
- Research prioritization

Is contingent on **full compliance** with contributor rules.

Non-compliance voids eligibility.

---

## 9. Governance Enforcement

### 9.1 Oversight
Contributor behavior is subject to:
- DAO governance
- Ethics review
- Compliance assessment

### 9.2 Sanctions
Sanctions may include:
- Public registry annotations
- Suspension of contribution privileges
- Disqualification from funding
- DAO censure

Sanctions are proportional and reviewable.

---

## 10. Legal & Regulatory Alignment

These rules align with:
- Research ethics frameworks
- Data protection laws (e.g., LGPD, GDPR)
- Medical AI governance principles
- Anticipated DeSci regulatory norms

Contributors remain responsible for jurisdiction-specific compliance.

---

## 11. Foundational Principle

> **Decentralization does not remove responsibility.**  
>  
> Contributors are custodians of truth, not anonymous actors.

---

### Status
**Registry Policy – Active Draft**  
Subject to DAO ratification and future evolution.
