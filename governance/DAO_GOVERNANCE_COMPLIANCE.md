# DAO_GOVERNANCE_COMPLIANCE.md  
**NeuroGrid Decentralized Governance & Compliance Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines how the NeuroGrid DAO operates **within legal, ethical, and regulatory boundaries**, ensuring that decentralization does not dilute accountability, compliance, or human oversight—particularly in bio-medical, AI, and DeSci contexts.

The DAO exists to **govern research coordination, funding allocation, and policy evolution**, not to bypass regulatory obligations.

---

## 2. Governance Philosophy

NeuroGrid follows a **Hybrid Governance Model**:

- Decentralized decision-making
- Centralized legal accountability
- Explicit human responsibility
- Regulatory supremacy over token consensus

> **Code may coordinate, but law governs.**

---

## 3. Scope of DAO Authority

The DAO **may** govern:

- Research funding allocation
- Contributor onboarding rules
- Policy amendments (non-regulatory)
- Incentive mechanisms
- Transparency and reporting standards

The DAO **may not** govern:

- Clinical decisions
- Patient-facing operations
- Regulatory compliance determinations
- Medical device classification
- Emergency response authority

---

## 4. Legal Entity Relationship

The DAO operates **in conjunction with** a registered legal entity (or entities).

Key principles:

- The legal entity bears regulatory responsibility
- DAO resolutions are advisory unless ratified
- Smart contracts do not replace contracts at law
- Jurisdictional compliance is mandatory

---

## 5. Regulatory Supremacy Clause

If a DAO vote conflicts with:

- Applicable law
- Regulatory guidance
- Ethics Charter
- Clinical governance requirements

➡️ **The vote is null and void.**

No on-chain mechanism may override off-chain legal obligations.

---

## 6. DAO Decision Classification

DAO proposals are categorized as follows:

| Class | Description | Binding Status |
|-----|------------|----------------|
| Class A | Informational | Non-binding |
| Class B | Policy Guidance | Conditionally binding |
| Class C | Funding Allocation | Binding upon review |
| Class D | Structural Changes | Requires legal ratification |
| Class E | Clinical / Regulatory | Prohibited |

---

## 7. Compliance Gatekeeping

All DAO proposals pass through mandatory gates:

1. **Ethics Review Gate**
2. **Compliance Review Gate**
3. **Risk Classification Gate**
4. **Legal Compatibility Check**

Failure at any gate halts execution.

---

## 8. Smart Contract Constraints

DAO smart contracts must enforce:

- Proposal classification
- Voting quorum thresholds
- Time-locks for execution
- Emergency pause functionality
- Audit logging

Contracts **must not** autonomously execute high-risk actions.

---

## 9. Token Holder Limitations

Token ownership does **not** grant:

- Clinical authority
- Regulatory authority
- Data access rights
- Decision rights over human subjects

Governance tokens represent **participation**, not power over people.

---

## 10. Transparency & Auditability

The DAO ensures:

- Public proposal records
- Immutable voting logs
- Rationale documentation
- Funding traceability
- Conflict-of-interest disclosures

All records are auditable by regulators.

---

## 11. Emergency Override Mechanism

In cases of:

- Patient risk
- Regulatory intervention
- Security compromise
- Ethical breach

An **Emergency Governance Council** may:

- Suspend DAO actions
- Pause smart contracts
- Override votes
- Notify authorities

Emergency actions are logged and reviewed post hoc.

---

## 12. Jurisdictional Awareness

DAO operations must respect:

- Local research regulations
- Cross-border data laws
- Medical device frameworks
- AI governance acts
- Financial compliance rules

Global participation does not imply global immunity.

---

## 13. Conflict Resolution

Disputes are resolved via:

1. Internal governance mediation
2. Legal arbitration
3. Court jurisdiction (if required)

On-chain outcomes do not preclude off-chain legal remedies.

---

## 14. Prohibited DAO Behaviors

The following are explicitly forbidden:

- Anonymous clinical governance
- Untraceable funding flows
- Shadow voting mechanisms
- Automated regulatory circumvention
- Governance capture via token concentration

---

## 15. Review & Amendment Process

This document may be amended only through:

- DAO proposal (Class D)
- Ethics and compliance review
- Legal ratification
- Public notice period

---

## 16. Foundational Statement

> **Decentralization distributes coordination —  
> not responsibility.**

---

### Status
**DAO Governance Compliance Framework – Active Draft**  
Aligned with DAO Scope, Ethics Charter, Compliance Scope, and Bio-Cybernetic Risk Framework.
