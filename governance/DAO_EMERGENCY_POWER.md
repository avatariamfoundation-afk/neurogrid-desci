**Emergency Authority, Safeguards, and Fail-Safe Governance Framework**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **Emergency Powers Framework** of the NeuroGrid DAO.  
Its purpose is to enable **rapid, lawful, and ethically constrained intervention** when system behavior, AI models, or operational conditions pose **immediate risk to patient safety, regulatory compliance, or system integrity**.

Emergency powers exist **only to reduce harm**, never to expand authority or bypass accountability.

---

## 2. Scope

DAO Emergency Powers apply to:

- AI model behavior affecting clinical monitoring
- Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) alert systems
- Bio-cybernetic and subcutaneous device integrations
- Data integrity or privacy breaches
- Regulatory non-compliance events
- Infrastructure compromise or adversarial attacks

These powers may be invoked **only under defined emergency conditions**.

---

## 3. Emergency Definition

An emergency is declared when **any one** of the following is present:

- Credible risk to patient safety
- Uncontrolled AI behavior or output drift
- Failure of RPM alert pathways
- Unauthorized data exposure
- Regulatory violation with immediate consequences
- Cybersecurity compromise affecting clinical trust

Emergencies must be **verifiable, time-bound, and documented**.

---

## 4. Emergency Authority Structure

### 4.1 Emergency Oversight Body
The **Emergency Oversight Council (EOC)** consists of:

- One technical lead
- One clinical safety authority
- One ethics representative
- One DAO governance delegate

No single individual may act unilaterally.

---

### 4.2 Authority Limitations

Emergency powers:

- Are **temporary**
- Are **revocable**
- Are **reviewable**
- Cannot modify governance rules permanently
- Cannot expand DAO authority beyond this document

---

## 5. Permitted Emergency Actions

The DAO may execute the following actions **only during an active emergency**:

- Suspend AI model deployment
- Freeze model updates or data ingestion
- Disable specific RPM alert pathways
- Trigger model rollback
- Pause device-AI integration
- Restrict data access temporarily
- Initiate incident notification procedures

All actions must be **proportional and reversible**.

---

## 6. Prohibited Actions

The following are strictly prohibited, even during emergencies:

- Permanent rule changes
- Bypassing ethics review retrospectively
- Suppressing incident disclosure
- Concealing adverse outcomes
- Continuing deployment of known harmful models
- Retaliation against whistleblowers

---

## 7. Emergency Activation Process

### Step 1 — Trigger Event
Emergency may be triggered by:

- Automated monitoring alerts
- Clinical incident reports
- Ethics review escalation
- Regulatory notice
- Security breach detection

---

### Step 2 — Emergency Declaration
The EOC must:

- Record the triggering event
- Classify emergency severity
- Define scope and duration
- Log declaration immutably

---

### Step 3 — Action Execution
Approved emergency actions are:

- Executed immediately
- Logged with timestamps
- Linked to specific risk mitigation goals

---

## 8. Time Limits & Expiry

Emergency powers are valid for:

- **Maximum 72 hours** per declaration

Extensions require:

- Formal justification
- Independent review
- DAO vote (if time permits)

Automatic expiration occurs if not renewed.

---

## 9. Transparency & Disclosure

All emergency actions must be:

- Logged on-chain or immutably recorded
- Disclosed internally immediately
- Disclosed externally where legally required
- Included in post-incident reports

Transparency is mandatory.

---

## 10. Post-Emergency Review

Within **14 days** of resolution:

- Full incident analysis is conducted
- Ethics review is completed
- Clinical impact is assessed
- Regulatory obligations are addressed
- Corrective actions are defined

Failure to complete review invalidates future emergency authority.

---

## 11. Accountability & Sanctions

Misuse of emergency powers may result in:

- Removal of governance privileges
- DAO sanctions
- Legal escalation
- Permanent exclusion from system governance

Emergency authority is a **duty**, not a privilege.

---

## 12. Alignment with Global Governance

This framework aligns with:

- EU MDR vigilance requirements
- FDA post-market safety obligations
- WHO AI governance guidance
- OECD AI accountability principles

Emergency actions must never conflict with mandatory reporting laws.

---

## 13. Ethical Foundation

> **Speed without restraint creates harm.  
> Authority without review destroys trust.  
> Emergency power exists only to protect life.**

---

## 14. Review & Amendment

This document is reviewed:

- Annually
- After every emergency invocation
- Upon major regulatory change

Amendments require full DAO approval.

---

### Status
**DAO Emergency Powers – Active Governance Document**  
Applies to all NeuroGrid systems, contributors, and governing entities.
