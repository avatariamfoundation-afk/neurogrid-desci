# DAO_EMERGENCY_VETO_AND_KILL-SWITCH_POLICY.md

## 1. Purpose
This policy establishes a binding emergency veto and kill-switch mechanism for DAO-governed systems, models, protocols, and smart contracts. It exists to enable rapid intervention in the event of critical safety, ethical, legal, or systemic failures while preserving decentralized governance principles.

## 2. Scope
Applies to:
- AI/ML models deployed under DAO authority
- Clinical and research decision-support systems
- Smart contracts and protocol logic
- Data access layers and federated nodes
- Public-facing research or inference services

## 3. Emergency Definition
An emergency is defined as any event that presents:
- Immediate risk to human safety or clinical integrity
- Severe model malfunction or uncontrolled behavior
- Confirmed data breach or integrity compromise
- Regulatory or legal exposure with imminent harm
- Governance capture or malicious DAO activity
- Irreversible system-wide failure propagation

## 4. Kill-Switch Authority
Emergency authority is strictly limited to:
- Independent Oversight Committee
- Designated Emergency Multisig Council
- Regulatory Liaison Node (where legally mandated)

No single individual may unilaterally trigger
