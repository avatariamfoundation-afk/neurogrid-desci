Human Authority, Responsibility & Traceability Framework

---

# 1. Purpose
This document defines the Human Decision Accountability Chain within the NeuroGrid ecosystem.

Its purpose is to ensure that:

All clinically relevant decisions have a clearly identifiable human authority

AI systems remain advisory and non-autonomous

Responsibility for action, inaction, and override is unambiguous

Accountability is preserved across decentralized governance structures

No AI output is ever the final decision-maker.

---

# 2. Scope
This framework applies to:

AI-assisted clinical decision support

Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) alerts and recommendations

Model-driven risk stratification

Governance and operational decisions influenced by AI outputs

Emergency actions involving AI-generated signals

It covers decision initiation, review, execution, and post-hoc evaluation.

---

# 3. Core Accountability Principle
Authority cannot be delegated to software.
Accountability cannot be distributed to abstractions.

Every consequential decision must terminate in a named human role.

---

# 4. Decision Actor Roles
A. AI System (Non-Authoritative)

Generates signals, recommendations, or risk indicators

Provides confidence, uncertainty, and rationale

Holds no authority to act independently

B. Clinical Operator

Licensed clinician or authorized healthcare professional

Primary decision authority in patient-impacting contexts

May accept, modify, or reject AI guidance

C. Supervising Authority

Senior clinician, medical director, or safety officer

Reviews escalated or contested decisions

Holds override authority in defined cases

D. Governance Authority

DAO governance bodies operating within compliance bounds

Responsible for policy, model lifecycle, and system rules

No authority over individual patient decisions

---

# 5. Decision Chain Structure
All AI-influenced decisions must follow a traceable chain:

AI signal generation

Human review and interpretation

Decision selection (accept / modify / reject)

Action execution

Outcome observation

Documentation and logging

Breaks in the chain are not permitted.

---

# 6. Decision Documentation Requirements
Each decision record must include:

AI model identifier and version

Timestamp of AI output

Confidence and uncertainty indicators

Human decision-maker identity (role-based)

Decision outcome and rationale

Deviations from AI recommendation (if any)

Incomplete records are non-compliant.

---

# 7. Override & Disagreement Handling
When human judgment conflicts with AI output:

The human decision prevails

Rationale must be documented

Overrides are logged for safety review

Patterns of disagreement trigger model evaluation

Override frequency is a monitored safety metric.

---

# 8. Escalation Protocols
Escalation is mandatory when:

Confidence is below validated thresholds

Patient safety risk is elevated

The decision exceeds the operator’s authority

Conflicts of interest are present

Escalations must follow predefined authority paths.

---

# 9. Emergency Decision Path
During emergencies:

AI may issue high-priority alerts

Human responders act under emergency protocols

Actions are logged in real time where possible

Post-event review and ratification are mandatory

Emergency context does not dissolve accountability.

---

# 10. DAO Boundary Conditions
The DAO:

Defines rules, thresholds, and permissions

Governs models, policies, and registries

Cannot make or influence individual clinical decisions

Cannot absolve individuals of responsibility

Clinical accountability is non-transferable.

---

# 11. Audit & Traceability
All decision chains must be:

Immutable

Timestamped

Role-attributed

Auditable by authorized parties

Traceability failures constitute a system integrity breach.

---

# 12. Training & Competency
Individuals participating in decision chains must:

Be appropriately credentialed

Understand AI system limitations

Receive periodic accountability training

Acknowledge responsibility boundaries

Lack of training invalidates authority.

---

# 13. Prohibited Practices
The following are prohibited:

Deferring decisions solely to AI outputs

Obscuring or anonymizing decision authority

Retroactive assignment of responsibility

Using DAO votes to shield clinical liability

Violations are treated as safety incidents.

---

# 14. Regulatory Alignment
This framework aligns with:

EU AI Act (Human oversight requirements)

FDA Clinical Decision Support guidance

ISO/IEC 62304 (Medical software lifecycle)

WHO AI ethics guidance

Medical professional accountability standards

---

# 15. Ethical Position
Systems advise.
Humans decide.
Humans answer.

Accountability is the cornerstone of safe intelligence.

---

# Status
Active – Binding Accountability Framework
