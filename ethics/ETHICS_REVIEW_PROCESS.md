**NeuroGrid DeSci – Ethics Review & Enforcement Process**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **mandatory ethics review process** governing all scientific, medical, AI, and bio-cybernetic activity within the NeuroGrid DeSci ecosystem.

The ethics review process exists to:
- Protect human dignity
- Prevent harm
- Ensure accountability
- Maintain global legitimacy
- Enable responsible acceleration of science

Ethics is **non-optional** and **non-negotiable**.

---

## 2. Scope

This ethics review process applies to:

- Datasets (clinical, biological, behavioral)
- AI models and training pipelines
- Post-operative care systems
- Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)
- Wearable and subcutaneous bio-cybernetic devices
- Funding proposals
- Experimental research initiatives
- Registry submissions
- DAO-governed research decisions

---

## 3. Ethics Review Triggers

An ethics review is **required** when any of the following conditions apply:

- Human data is used (directly or indirectly)
- Medical or health-related claims are involved
- AI outputs influence clinical decisions
- RPM or patient monitoring is deployed
- Bio-cybernetic or implanted systems are involved
- Funding is requested for human-impacting research
- Cross-border data movement occurs
- Experimental or pre-clinical research is proposed

---

## 4. Ethics Review Levels

Ethics reviews operate on a **risk-tiered system**.

---

### Level 1 – Minimal Risk Review

Applies to:
- Synthetic data
- Fully anonymized datasets
- Non-clinical AI research
- Documentation-only contributions

Review focus:
- Data origin verification
- Consent declarations
- Risk classification confirmation

---

### Level 2 – Human-Adjacent Review

Applies to:
- RPM systems
- Wearable devices
- Clinical decision support tools
- Post-operative monitoring analytics

Review focus:
- Informed consent frameworks
- Safety and fallback mechanisms
- Human oversight
- Bias and harm analysis

---

### Level 3 – High-Risk / Clinical Review

Applies to:
- Bio-cybernetic implants
- Subcutaneous monitoring devices
- Experimental medical AI
- Predictive treatment or pharmaceutical guidance

Review focus:
- Full ethical justification
- Medical regulatory alignment
- Long-term risk modeling
- Independent expert validation

---

## 5. Ethics Review Submission Requirements

All ethics review submissions must include:

- Clear description of purpose and scope
- Data sources and consent mechanisms
- Jurisdictional context
- Risk classification and mitigation plan
- Human oversight model
- Intended deployment environment
- Monitoring and incident response plan

Incomplete submissions are automatically rejected.

---

## 6. Ethics Review Bodies

---

### 6.1 Ethics Review Committee (ERC)

The ERC is responsible for:
- Reviewing submissions
- Assigning risk levels
- Issuing approvals, conditions, or rejections
- Escalating high-risk cases

The ERC operates independently from funding incentives.

---

### 6.2 External Expert Panels (Optional)

For Level 3 cases, the ERC may require:
- Independent clinicians
- Bioethicists
- Regulatory specialists
- AI safety experts

External review does not remove contributor responsibility.

---

## 7. Ethics Review Outcomes

Possible outcomes include:

- **Approved** – Proceed as submitted
- **Conditionally Approved** – Changes required
- **Deferred** – Insufficient information
- **Rejected** – Ethical risk unacceptable
- **Suspended** – Post-approval violations detected

All outcomes are recorded in the registry.

---

## 8. Post-Approval Monitoring

Ethics approval is **not permanent**.

Approved projects must:
- Report material changes
- Log adverse events
- Submit periodic ethics updates
- Allow audit and inspection

Failure triggers review escalation.

---

## 9. Ethics Violations

Examples of violations include:
- Misrepresentation of consent
- Undisclosed data sources
- Harmful AI outputs
- Bypassing human oversight
- Unauthorized clinical claims
- Deployment outside approved scope

Violations result in enforcement action.

---

## 10. Enforcement Actions

The DAO and registry may enforce:

- Ethics flags
- Funding suspension
- Registry delisting
- Public disclosure
- Permanent contributor bans

Severe violations may be referred to authorities.

---

## 11. Appeals Process

Contributors may appeal decisions by:
- Submitting additional evidence
- Requesting independent review
- DAO arbitration (non-legal)

Appeals do not halt enforcement unless explicitly granted.

---

## 12. Transparency & Recordkeeping

All ethics reviews are:
- Logged
- Time-stamped
- Versioned
- Auditable

Sensitive details may be redacted, but decisions remain public.

---

## 13. Alignment with Global Ethics Standards

This process aligns with:
- Declaration of Helsinki
- Belmont Report
- WHO Ethics Guidelines
- UNESCO AI Ethics
- OECD AI Principles

Ethical compliance precedes innovation speed.

---

## 14. Foundational Ethics Statement

> **Science without ethics is not progress.  
> Decentralization without responsibility is failure.**

---

### Status
**Ethics Review Process – Active Draft**  
Subject to DAO ratification and regulatory alignment updates.
