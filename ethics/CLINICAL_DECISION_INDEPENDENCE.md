# CLINICAL_DECISION_INDEPENDENCE.md

## 1. PURPOSE
This policy establishes and safeguards the principle of Clinical Decision Independence within the NeuroGrid ecosystem. Its purpose is to ensure that all clinical decisions remain under the sole authority and professional judgment of qualified human clinicians, free from coercion, automation pressure, governance overreach, or algorithmic determinism.

AI systems may inform decisions; they may never replace them.

## 2. SCOPE
This policy applies to:
- All clinical workflows supported by AI systems
- Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) outputs
- Decision-support tools and alerts
- Governance, funding, and incentive structures
- Research-to-clinical translation activities

It applies across all jurisdictions and regulatory environments.

## 3. CORE PRINCIPLE
Clinical decisions must be:
- Made by licensed clinicians
- Grounded in professional judgment
- Independent of AI, DAO, or financial influence
- Accountable to medical ethics and law

No system output has authority absent human judgment.

## 4. AI SYSTEM ROLE LIMITATION
AI systems within NeuroGrid are strictly limited to:
- Advisory recommendations
- Risk stratification
- Pattern detection
- Information summarization

AI systems must not:
- Issue autonomous clinical decisions
- Enforce or compel actions
- Penalize clinicians for disagreement
- Imply obligation or mandate

## 5. GOVERNANCE AND INCENTIVE CONSTRAINTS
DAO governance, funding mechanisms, or token-based systems must not:
- Incentivize specific clinical decisions
- Penalize deviation from AI recommendations
- Create indirect pressure on clinical judgment
- Link compensation to model adherence

Clinical neutrality is mandatory.

## 6. CLINICIAN DISAGREEMENT RIGHTS
Clinicians retain the explicit right to:
- Override AI outputs
- Disagree with system recommendations
- Select alternative clinical pathways
- Document independent reasoning

Disagreement is not considered system failure.

## 7. DOCUMENTATION AND TRACEABILITY
When AI input is used:
- The clinician’s final decision must be recorded
- Any divergence from AI output must be permitted
- Documentation must reflect human authority

Records must clearly distinguish AI input from clinical judgment.

## 8. TRAINING AND AWARENESS
Clinicians interacting with AI systems must:
- Be trained on AI limitations
- Understand non-deterministic behavior
- Be informed of bias and uncertainty risks

Training reinforces independence, not reliance.

## 9. MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT
The system must:
- Monitor for automation bias indicators
- Detect patterns of undue reliance
- Flag governance or incentive violations

Confirmed violations require remediation.

## 10. PROHIBITED PRACTICES
The following are strictly prohibited:
- Auto-execution of clinical actions
- Hidden enforcement of AI outputs
- Suppression of clinician dissent
- Retaliation for independent judgment

Violations constitute critical governance breaches.

## 11. OVERSIGHT
Compliance with this policy is subject to:
- Clinical Safety Committee oversight
- Ethics review
- Independent audit
- Regulatory inspection

Non-compliance triggers escalation.

## 12. REGULATORY ALIGNMENT
This policy aligns with:
- Medical ethics principles
- EU AI Act human oversight requirements
- FDA GMLP guidance
- WHO AI ethics frameworks
- Professional clinical accountability standards

## 13. ENFORCEMENT
Violation of this policy may result in:
- System suspension
- Governance sanctions
- Contractual action
- Regulatory notification where required
